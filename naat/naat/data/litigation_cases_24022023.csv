This conflict gave place to several lawsuits seeking protection for the ecosystem, including injunctions and damages for environmental and health consequences of the fires. One of these claims introduced climate concerns.<br><br></div><div>On July 03, 2020, two NGOs and a group of children represented by their parents filed a constitutional collective claim (amparo colectivo ambiental) against three Argentinean Provinces and a Municipality. The plaintiffs allege that the government entities are failing in their duties regarding the protection and sound environmental management of the inter-jurisdictional ecosystem, which is key for mitigation and adaptation of climate change while also being at risk due to its negative impacts. The complaint asks the Supreme Court to (i) declare the ecosystem as an entity subject to rights, (ii) order the defendants to prepare and implement a coordinated environmental management and land use plan that recognizes the vulnerability of the ecosystem and its relevance for future generations, (iii) designate a ‘guardian’ for the entity, responsible for monitoring its conservation and sustainable use, as well as informing the Supreme Court about the enforcement of the judgment, and (iv) order that broad, early and effective public participation is guaranteed in any decision-making regarding the future management of the ecosystem. The complaint relies primarily on the Argentinian constitution, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement, General Environmental Law No. 25.675 and Environmental Law to Control Burning Activities No. 23.919. The complaint also references laws in other countries recognizing the rights of nature, rivers, and other non-human entities.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On 11 August 2020, the Supreme Court made a first decision in one related case (Equística Defensa del Medio Ambiente v.

The Hunter Environment Lobby objected to the proposal, notably on the ground that the extensions would have an important impact on climate change. Nevertheless, the project was approved by the Planning Minister in November 2010 and the Hunter Environment Lobby appealed. In its decision, the Court distinguished between direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 GHG emissions) and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 GHG emissions), i.e. emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity. With respect to direct emissions, the Court held that it was lawful and reasonably implementable to take them into account in the approval process. The Court further highlighted that it was not discriminatory to do so as upcoming approvals would follow the same rule. However, the Court refused to impose any condition with respect to indirect emissions. The Court thus affirmed the approval, but subject to certain conditions, including a condition which required the offset of any direct GHG emissions from the mine. This condition could be suspended if another law or regulation was introduced which would cover these emissions. Following this initial decision, the Australian Government introduced a carbon price, which was implemented through federal legislation. In light of this new scheme, in a subsequent decision the Court held that it was valid for the Minister to decide that the condition on the mine relating to offsetting of direct emissions was no longer necessary."

On appeal, the Full Court upheld the dismissal. The appellant appealed again to the High Court of Australia, which found that the proceeding should not have been dismissed because the possibility remained that the laws are invalid due to the informal arrangement between the State and the Commonwealth. The Federal Court rejected Spencer's claim in 2015, after holding a full trial and concluding that there was no ""informal agreement"" between New South Wales and the Commonwealth and that the laws prohibiting Spencer from clearing native vegetation did not thereby effect an ""acquisition"" of his property. Spencer has appealed."

Defendant Macquarie Generation's motion for summary dismissal was denied on March 22, 2010, although Justice Pain did dismiss the applicant's case in part. The court found that even if Defendant has an implied authority to emit some amount of carbon dioxide in generating electricity under its license, that authority is limited to an amount which has reasonable regard and care for people and the environment. 


Macquarie appealed the court's finding that it was subject to implied CO2 emissions limits.  The implicit conditions were based on common law principles that require prevention of emissions in excess of levels that could be achieved by exercising ""reasonable regard and care for the interests of others and the environment."" The court of appeals reversed the lower court's decision, reasoning that these common law principles only protected private rights (such as a nuisance claim) and were not applicable to a permit granted under a statute."

The Tribunal determined that the development application warranted conditional approval. With respect to potential flooding, the Tribunal found that the level of the water table over the lifetime of the development, including anticipated increase in the water table due to sea level rise by 2100, would not compromise the structural stability of the building or cause water ingress. Thus, the proposal did not warrant refusal because of potential for flooding.

The Department failed to respond to the request within 45 days (as required by the Act). After proceedings were commenced, some documents were produced and issues in dispute were eventually narrowed to four particular documents.  Three of these documents related to allocation of licenses to mine coal, and the fourth related to the premium feed-in tariff scheme.  In withholding these documents, the Department relied on an exception to FOIA which protects cabinet documents (for the three coal related documents), and an exception which protects internal working documents (in relation to all four documents). The Tribunal held that, with the exception of an introductory portion of one document, that the three coal license related documents were protected by the exception for internal working documents, as they had been prepared in order to brief the Minister on issues ""of the utmost importance to Victorians.""  The high level nature of the briefing documents, and the sensitivity of the issues involved, were considerations that weighed against their release under FOIA.

Plaintiffs alleged that the need for those protections and the cause of the properties' partial loss of value was the fault of the Council. In the 1960s and 70s, the Council constructed a form of hard shoreline armoring—""an artificial headland protected by a rock seawall."" Then, between 2006 and 2010, the Council issued draft planning documents (i) prohibiting the plaintiffs from armoring their own segments of shoreline and (ii) proposing a policy of managed retreat in response to rising seas and an encroaching shoreline. The Coastal Protection Act provides that such plans only become final and effective after approval by the New South Wales Minister for Planning; the Council withdrew its draft Coastal Zone Management Plan in May 2011, before the Minister considered it. Plaintiffs presented two alternative theories in support of their claim: either that the Council was negligent for installing hard shoreline armoring that has since displaced wave action to plaintiffs' adjacent portions of beach, worsening erosion there; or that the council's armoring constitutes an instance of public nuisance. Plaintiffs also argued that their injury was compounded by the Council's issuance and withdrawal of planning documents, and persistent position that managed retreat is the preferred policy response to shoreline encroachment. After the plaintiffs' suit survived a motion to dismiss in March 2016, the Council's insurers, who had been steering the defense in the case, agreed to a settlement. As a result, the court never determined legal liability for the claims alleged. The settlement's terms bar the Council from removing existing coastal armoring (chiefly rock, concrete, and rubble barriers) on the plaintiffs' parcels unless the plaintiffs agree to such removal. Should plaintiffs want to add to that armoring, the must apply within one year of the settlement, dated August 2016, and then must make the requested additions within one year of approval of their application. Any subsequent repairs or additions may only be proposed after 20 years, and the Council has not guaranteed that such proposals would be approved."

By refusing to review the Queensland Supreme Court's decision in Coast and Country Association of Queensland Inc v. Smith, the High Court of Australia effectively resolved a question about this review process, namely how to interpret the emissions of coal burned by the end-user of Australian coal. Environmentalists have long argued that even though coal emissions are remote from the mine, they should be considered in EIAs because they are a foreseeable result of mining and would not necessarily occur if the coal were not dug out of an Australian mine. The opposing view holds that coal combustion is physically remote from mining operations, that demand rather than supply drives the market for coal (meaning that mining more Australian coal does not necessarily cause more emissions globally), and that the Environmental Protection Act therefore does not require consideration of coal combustion emissions in EIAs for mines. The Coast and Country decision adopts the latter view. The High Court has not, by refusing to review the Supreme Court of Queensland's decision, endorsed that court's reasoning, but it has indicated that it will not take up cases challenging the conclusion in Coast and Country regarding the proper scope of a mine's EIA. Legally, the basis for that conclusion relates to lower courts' responsibility for determining factual questions, such as the scope of coal mining operations and the nature of the market for coal. Practically, that conclusion means that environmentalists cannot expect to persuade Queensland courts that the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) requires consideration of whether a new coal mine will increase global greenhouse gas emissions."

Specifically, it sought information from the regional flood control authority, Melbourne Water, about changes to flood risk driven by sea level rise. That query prompted Melbourne Water to examine the property and recommend requiring the house be elevated substantially above what was called for in the permitted design. The Tribunal found that this recommendation reflected the best available information and, citing the precautionary principle and principle of intergenerational equity, authorized grant of the permit subject to the requirement that the house be elevated per Melbourne Water's recommendation."

That denial was based on the East Gippsland Catchment Management Authority (EGCMA) finding that the new building would impermissibly intensify development in a floodplain. The Tribunal disagreed with the EGCMA's assessment of the flood risk but upheld the denial nonetheless on the grounds that permission to build in the desired location would put the building in the path of flooding driven by climate change and sea level rise. The Tribunal also noted that the Shire Council faced the difficult task of making planning decisions amid a policy context in which the developing understanding of climate change impacts was leading to the imposition of new state-wide restrictions.

The Tribunal evaluated arguments relating to each of 11 contested documents and ultimately concluded that the interest of the public weighed on both sides of the case: the public had an interest in knowing how the Victorian and federal governments had negotiated issues related to climate change policy; but the public also had an interest in the Victorian government's staff being free to deliberate without concern that those deliberations should be public. On this basis, the Tribunal upheld the government's refusal to produce the 11 contested documents."

Melbourne Water, the regional flood manager, had indicated that it did not object to the project, provided the ground floor was elevated to an adequate height. The core issue for the Tribunal was whether a coastal hazard vulnerability assessment—which would specify the nature and degree of risk arising from sea level rise and related flooding—was prerequisite to the council's review of the building application. Noting a recent change in state planning policy and observing that ""coastal hazard vulnerability assessments will too become more routine in the planning process,"" the Tribunal upheld the council's refusal and instructed Owen to commission an assessment before resubmitting his application.


The same parties again came before the Tribunal after Owen commissioned an assessment. The Tribunal found the assessment inadequate because it had considered only flooding related to coastal hazards and had ignored the risks attendant to riverine flooding, which was also expected to worsen with climate change."

As part of its consideration of climate change impacts, the court held that both upstream and downstream emissions of the project should be considered by the Planning Department because the EPA and its regulations require consideration of ""the principles of ecologically sustainable development"" (""ESD"") which can encompass climate change impacts. The court also pointed to the requirements under the EPA to consider ""any environmental planning instrument"" and cited language in the State Environmental Planning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive Industries) of 2009 and the 2010 Gloucester Local Environmental Plan as including consideration of ESD and the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions associated with a project.&nbsp;<br><br>The court recognized the link between these emissions and climate change, remaining unpersuaded by petitioner's arguments related to market substitution, carbon leakage, the theoretical possibility that other projects would offset these emissions, and the inefficiency of this denial as a mechanism for global abatement of emissions.

While not foreclosing all mining projects, the court ruled that this project was not a ""sustainable use"" because of the combination of climate change impacts of the project and the high environmental and social costs of locating a coal mine in this particular location. Gloucester Resources Limited did not file an appeal by the court-designated deadline of May 8, 2019."

The plaintiffs, represented by the New South Wales Environmental Defenders Office, are Australians who allege that they have been harmed by bush fires made likely or more intense by climate change. According to news reports, the case was brought under the New South Wales Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997, which requires the Environmental Protection Authority to “develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environment protection."" The summons alleges that, although the New South Wales Climate Change Policy framework endorses the Paris Agreement and contains an aspirational long-term objective to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority has failed to develop guidelines or a policy to regulate greenhouse gases consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On June 4 the respondent filed its points of defense, asserting that it has complied with its duty by developing guidelines and policies from time to time to address greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>On November 4, 2020, the Court issued an order allowing testimony from the plaintiff's expert, Australian Chief Scientist Professor Penny Sackett, on climate change, including whether emissions trajectories in New South Wales and Australia are on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees.

The Court found that the POEA's duty to develop environmental protection instruments includes the duty to develop climate change protection instruments. The Court pointed to evidence presented by Professor Penny Sackett, and the IPCC reports which she relied on, to conclude that ""the threat to the environment of climate change is of sufficiently great magnitude and sufficiently great impact as to be one against which the environment needs to be protected."" The EPA had failed to fulfill its duty to protect from this threat because none of the instruments it presented adequately provided for protection from climate change. The documents it presented were either not prepared by the EPA or were ""directed towards ancillary or insignificant causes or consequences of climate change."" According to <a href=""https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/matt-kean-inaction-climate-change-covid-nsw/13535922"">media reports</a>, the government will not be appealing the ruling but will be doing everything possible to give it effect."

The protesters blocked a railway line that provides access to a coal loading facility by using tubular steel attachment devices to ""lock"" themselves to a 44 gallon drum filled with concrete, creating a device known as a ""dragon's den."" The devices can only be released voluntarily, or if someone else cuts the device, and cutting the device risks injury to the protesters. The defendants were charged with obstructing a railway; trespassing on a railway; using a dangerous attachment device to interfere with transport infrastructure; and contravening a direction or requirement. The dangerous attachment device offense was a new offense created by 2019 legislation that prohibits the use of devices such as ""dragon dens,"" which was introduced in response to protests against coal mining and regarding climate change. The Acting Magistrate convicted and sentenced the defendants to three months imprisonment for that offense. Convictions were not recorded for the other offenses.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On appeal, the district court concluded that the device the protesters used fell within the definition of a ""dragon's den,"" but that the gravity of the offense was minimal given the lack of evidence that any loss was suffered, that members of the public were burdened, or that there was violence or the threat of violence. The court further explained that the defendants ""have the right to express their views and to protest against an activity to which they object subject only to such restrictions as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for (amongst other legitimate aims) the prevention of disorder or crime or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others,"" and that ""the motive for the commission of the offen[s]e will often be relevant to the moral culpability of the offender, the weight to given to personal deterrence and it may affect the weight to be given to general deterrence.""

The lawsuit sought an injunction to stop the Australian Government from approving an extension of the Whitehaven Vickery coal mine. The plaintiffs claimed to represent all people under 18, and argued that Federal Minister Sussan Ley has a common law duty of care for young people. They further asserted that digging up and burning coal will exacerbate climate change and harm young people in the future. Plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the Minister from approving the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On May 27, 2021, the Federal Court of Australia established a new duty of care to avoid causing personal harm to children but declined to issue an injunction to force the Minister to block the coal mine extension. The Court concluded that ""the applicants have established that the Minister has a duty to take reasonable care to avoid causing personal injury to the Children when deciding, under s 130 and s 133 of the EPBC Act, to approve or not approve the Extension Project."" In establishing the duty of care, the Court found that the foreseeable harm from the project, if the risks were to come true, would be ""catastrophic"", and therefore children should be considered persons who would be so directly affected that the Minister ought to consider their interests when making the approval decision. In declining to issue an injunction, the Court found that the plaintiffs had not established that it is probable that the Minister would breach the duty of care in making the approval decision, and had not established that they will have no further opportunity to apply for an injunction.<br><br>On July 8, 2021, the Court issued a declaration that ""The [Minister] has a duty to take reasonable care . . . to avoid causing personal injury or death to persons who were under 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in Australia at the time of the commencement of this proceeding arising from emissions of carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere."" In issuing the declaration, the Court rejected arguments by the Minister to limit the declaration to only the applicants. Instead, the Court declared the duty applied to all Australian young people because both the applicants and Australian young people had the ""same interest."" The Court ordered the Minister to pay costs.<br><br>On September 13, 2021, the Ministry of Environment filled an appeal questioning the judge’s finding that the Minister owes a duty of care to avoid causing personal injury to children related to anthropogenic climate change. The appeal is based on the separation of powers and the argument that the Minister’s decision is a matter of policy and subject to discretion. The regulation of GHG emissions is better suited for the Executive, and no novel duty of care should be recognized. The appeal also questioned whether the approved project would cause a net increase in global GHG emissions and the reversed onus of proof in approaching this issue.<br><br>Despite the Federal Court’s decision, on September 15, 2021, the Minister granted approval for the proposed mine expansion. A hearing was held on October 18-20, 2021. On March 15, 2022, the Full Federal Court of Australia unanimously overturned the primary judge’s decision to impose a duty of care on the Minister. The three judges had separate reasonings. Chief Justice Allsop found that the duty would require consideration of questions of policy “unsuitable for the judicial branch to resolve.” Justice Beach found insufficient “closeness” between the Minister and the children but left open the possibility of a future claim if any of the children suffered damage. Justice Wheelahan found that (i) the EPBC Act cannot establish a duty of care relationship between the Minister and children, (ii) establishing a duty would be incoherent with the Minister’s functions under the EPBC Act and (iii) it was not foreseeable that approval of the coal mine extension would cause personal injury to the children. Despite allowing the Minister’s appeal, the Court rejected the Minister’s argument that the primary judge made findings based on evidence of climate change that were unfounded. This means that the primary judge's findings of fact about the risk of harm of climate change to children remain. The Full Federal Court noted that “the nature of the risks and the dangers from global warming, including the possible catastrophe that may engulf the world and humanity” were never in dispute."

The reason: authorizing the runway would do more harm to the public interest than good, primarily because it would be contrary to Austria's national and international obligations to mitigate the causes of climate change. Of the authorities cited by the court, the most important was Austria's Climate Protection Act of 2011, which set emissions reduction targets for various sectors, including the transport sector. Because a third runway was expected to increase Austria's annual CO2 emissions, the court concluded that it would be at odds with the provisions of the 2011 Act as well as with Austria's constitution and its international commitments under EU law and the Paris Agreement.&nbsp;<br><br>The Austrian Constitutional Court overturned the Federal Administrative Court's decision in June 2017, citing multiple errors that led the lower court to improperly give weight to climate change and land use considerations in the balancing test it used to consider the public's interest in a third runway. The errors identified by the Constitutional Court included: - misconstruing the Air Traffic Law's instruction to consider environmental protection over-broadly by factoring in environmental impacts beyond those directly attributable to air traffic; - wrongly including in emissions projections aircraft emissions attributable to flight segments other than landing and takeoff; - improperly superimposing regional greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets on an analysis of legal rights and obligations under the federal Air Traffic Law; and - misapplication of the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, which the Constitutional Court explained are the source of international obligations for Austria but are not generally applicable in the domestic legal context (""sie erzeugen daher nur eine völkerrechtliche Verpflichtung Osterreichs und sind innerstaatlich nicht unmittelbar anwendbar"").&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>&nbsp;In March 2018, the Administrative Court issued a new decision that approves construction of the third runway.&nbsp;"

They demanded the Minister to issue an ordinance establishing a gradual ban on the sale of fossil fuels in Austria. In concrete terms, the sale of solid fossil fuels should be banned from January 1, 2025, the sale of fossil heating oil from January 1, 2030, the sale of fossil fuels from January 1, 2035, and the sale of fossil fuels for aviation from January 1, 2040. In support of their claim, the applicants argued that they were directly affected by the climate crisis, which mainly results from burning fossil fuels - a practice that needs to be halted to protect life, health, and the environment.<br>One of the applicants asserted that climate change-induced heat waves posed a significant health risk due to pre-existing conditions; another applicant brought forward that she would severely suffer from the impacts of climate change due to her young age. The applicant municipality, in turn, stated that due to its location in the Alpine region, it was exposed to a significant risk of landslides during heavy rainfall events, which endangered the lives and health of its citizens. And the fourth applicant, a farmer, argued that climate change-induced drought and resulting crop failures endangered her livelihood and caused ecological harm.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The applicants relied on EU Secondary Law, fundamental rights and the Austrian Trade Regulation Act to support their claim. When issuing the demanded sales ban, the applicants proposed that the Minister should rely on the Austrian Trade Regulations Act. Its Art 69 authorizes the Minister, in order to avoid endangering the life or health of individuals or to prevent environmental pollution, to determine by ordinance which measures tradespeople shall take with regard to the goods they produce or sell. According to the applicants, the Minister could thus, for instance, prohibit operators of petrol stations from selling fossil fuels. Apart from isolated exceptions, individuals are not entitled to demand the issuance of an ordinance by an administrative authority under Austrian law. The applicants thus resorted to international law and derived their right to request the above-mentioned sales ban from EU Secondary Law and fundamental rights. The EU’s Effort Sharing Regulation (2018/842) sets binding reduction targets for its Member States and provides that Austria has to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 36% up to 2030. Austria has to comply with this obligation, in particular by enacting laws and ordinances. According to the applicants, the Effort Sharing Regulation (and in particular its Art 4) aims to protect European citizens from the dangers of climate change. Therefore, this obligation gives rise to a subjective right of European citizens - they may require the enactment of ordinances and demand compliance with EU reduction targets. In their argumentation, the plaintiffs referred to earlier case law regarding air pollution control in which the European Court of Justice recognized a subjective right to require the issuing of an ordinance in case of exceeding of limit values. (See Janacek v. Bayern, ECLI:EU:C:2008:447, ClientEarth v. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, ECLI:EU:C:2013:805). In addition, the applicants derived their right to demand the issuance of an ordinance from fundamental rights, in particular from Art 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which oblige the state to take measures against climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In the first instance, the Federal Minister dismissed the application for lack of competence. In her decision, the Minister argued that the requested measure, namely a transition from fossil to clean energy, was not covered by its constitutional competences, and that she was thus not authorized to issue the requested ordinance. According to the Minister, Art 69 of the Austrian Trade Regulation Act only concerns the prevention of threats specific to the trade and industry sector. It cannot be invoked for higher-level objectives such as the transition to green energy.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In April 2022, in the second instance, the administrative court of Vienna addressed whether the plaintiffs could demand the enactment of the ordinance phasing out fossil fuels they sought. With regard to the Effort Sharing Regulation, the court held that the regulation is directed at EU Member states and that subjective rights could principally arise from the regulatory content of the regulation. The court, however, concluded that the regulation’s wording does not show the European legislator’s intent to grant EU citizens subjective rights. Therefore, it held that the applicants do not have subjective rights to demand compliance with the Effort Sharing Regulation or the enactment of the proposed ordinance. In the context of fundamental rights, the court held that legislative and administrative inaction cannot be challenged in court and that it was not competent to order an administrative authority to issue an ordinance. Furthermore, it held that the state’s duty to protect from fundamental rights, in particular from Art 2 of the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, would only apply to localized natural disasters and hazards. Therefore, the applicants could not demand the enactment of an ordinance for phasing out fossil fuels based on fundamental rights. The plaintiffs envisage an appeal against this decision to the Constitutional Court and the High Administrative Court.<br><br>"

The complainant argued that the term SAF had not been clearly defined and was misleading in itself. The complainant stressed that Austrian Airlines had not used SAF with an 100% net saving potential which the advertisement implied. Thus, the SAF itself did not lead to carbon neutral flying. The complainant pointed out that Austrian Airlines purchased more SAF than required in order to meet the demand of a person purchasing 100% SAF-option without adequately explaining this to the consumer.&nbsp;<br><br>The Austrian Advertising Council found a breach of articles. 1.6 (environment) and 1.1 (general advertising principles) of the Ethics Code.

The suit named the Belgian State, the Walloon Region, the Flemish Region, and the Brussels-Capital Region as defendants. Specifically, plaintiffs called for reductions of 40% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 87.5% below 1990 levels by 2050.</div><div><br></div><div>From February 2019 through March 2020, the parties submitted their main conclusions and final conclusions. In their main conclusions, the plaintiffs seek a Court injunction directing the government to reduce emissions 42 to 48% in 2025 and at least 55 to 65% in 2030. Oral arguments were heard from March 16 to 26, 2021.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On June 17, 2021, the Brussels Court of First Instance held that the Belgium government breached its duty of care by failing to take necessary measures to prevent the harmful effects of climate change, but declined to set specific reduction targets on separation of powers grounds.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Court first analysed whether the claim was admissible, and, in doing so, whether the plaintiffs established that the proceedings would provide a benefit to them. Article 17 of the Judicial Code excludes actions brought in the general interest that only indirectly benefit the plaintiff. The Court found that both the 58,000 co-plaintiffs and the Klimaatzaak organization have a personal interest in the action. The citizen co-plaintiffs have a direct, personal interest because they seek to hold Belgian authorities responsible for the climate consequences on their daily lives, and the fact that other Belgian citizens may also suffer damages does not transform their interest into a general one. The Klimaatzaak organization has a direct, personal interest in part because environmental organizations have a privileged status to sue to defend the environmental from harm.<br><br></div><div>The Court found the federal state and the three regions jointly and individually in breach of their duty of care for failing to enact good climate governance. The Court found that despite being aware of the certain risk of dangerous climate change to the country's population, the authorities failed to take necessary action, meaning that they failed to act with prudence and diligence under Article 1382 of the Civil Code. Further, by failing to take sufficient climate action to protect the life and privacy of the plaintiffs, the defendants were in breach of their obligations under Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</div><div><br></div><div>However, the Court declined to issue an injunction ordering the government to set the specific emission reduction targets requested by the plaintiffs. The Court found that the separation of powers doctrine limited the Court's ability to set such targets, and doing so would contravene legislative or administrative authority. Neither European nor international law required the specific reduction targets requested by the plaintiffs, and that the scientific report that they relied on, while scientifically meritorious, was not legally binding. The specific targets, therefore, were a matter for the legislative and executive bodies to decide.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On November 17, 2021, Klimaatzaak appealed the judgment of the Brussels Court of First Instance. The appeal is aimed at the Tribunal's refusal to set specific binding targets related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over time. The Brussels Court of Appeal will review both the factual and the legal components of the case."

ClientEarth alleges that over half of bonds purchased under the CSPP were issued by greenhouse-gas intensive sectors and that the program, therefore, exacerbates the climate crisis. ClientEarth alleges that the Belgian National Bank's participation in the CSPP, by not taking into account climate, environment, and human rights impacts, violated Article 11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and Article 37 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (both concern the obligation to integrate environmental protection into EU policies). As part of its case, ClientEarth sought a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice to determine whether the decision to establish the CSPP was lawful; it argues that it was not because of the failure to take into account climate considerations in designing the CSPP as required by EU law, because the CSPP is itself inconsistent with EU climate policy, and become it undermines the European Union's emissions reduction targets.<br><br></div><div>In December 2021, the Brussels Tribunal of First Instance rejected ClientEarth's application on procedural grounds.

The process for obtaining such a permit includes a public inquiry, during which 51 objections to the project were raised. The municipal authority refused to deliver the permit to the requesting company on the basis of the fact that the envisaged gas station was not “future proof” in that it did not include a recharge point for electric cars nor did it provide for compressed natural gas.<br><br></div><div>In the meantime, the local authorities of Boechout adopted a “2020 charter” to become a climate neutral municipality, following which they established a climate action program.

The Council decided that the environmental permit was not carefully motivated because there was no research on whether the project would be compatible with the environmental objectives of the community of Boechout or whether mitigating measures would be sufficient to compensate the negative advice of the community of Boechout. On this ground, the Council suspended the decision of the provincial government on April 22, 2021.<br><br></div><div>In the primary procedure, which sought to annul the permit, the Council found on December 9, 2022, that there was insufficient justification with regard to the gas station’s compatibility with the residential area in which it was to be built and with its immediate surroundings; such compatibility is an important component of “good spatial planning,” and, as such, suffices as a ground to refuse to deliver an environmental permit. (As is common practice in Belgian law, the Council only discussed this plea, which is in itself was sufficient to annul the decision to deliver the permit, and ignored the other arguments of the plaintiffs.)<br><br></div><div>This case is indicative of the growing tendency under (Flemish) Belgian environmental law to assess environmental permit requests in light of climate objectives such as climate neutrality.

The decision also states that even in the face of strong evidence that the company committed environmental violations in 2012, it is not possible to impose the requests made by the plaintiff, because it is not known whether the company continues to practice the same acts.

The court further found that the judiciary, in turn, must act to avoid the regression of environmental protection. The Supreme Court clarified that environmental law treaties constitute a particular type of human rights treaty, which enjoy “supranational” status. This “supralegality” of human rights treaties means that they are above “regular” laws in the legal hierarchy. Accordingly, any Brazilian law or decree that contradicts the Paris Agreement, including the nationally determined contribution, may be invalidated. Any action or omission contrary to this protection is a direct violation of the Constitution and human rights. The constitutional duty to allocate the funds effectively means that there is a duty to mitigate climate change considering the international commitments under the climate change framework.<br><br>"

Plaintiffs allege that the federal government has failed to comply with its own action plans to prevent deforestation and mitigate and adapt to climate change, violating national law and fundamental rights. Plaintiffs assert that the government has failed to meet the Brazilian emissions targets set out in the Climate Change National Policy Act, a binding act passed by the Brazilian legislature. In order to meet these targets, the federal government issued a decree setting out specific action plans for preventing and controlling deforestation in various Brazilian biomes, as well as outlining sectoral plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation. A key part of this decree is the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). By failing to meet critical targets in the PPCDAm and emissions targets, plaintiffs allege that the government is violating fundamental rights and national law.

The lower court found that both lawsuits aimed at combating illegal deforestation in the Amazon and both referred to the PPCDAm, thus presenting “sufficient similarity” or “close connection” between the issues discussed, thereby “giving rise to an undue risk of conflicting solutions.” IEA appealed the transfer decision to the federal appellate court (TRF4).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>On August 20, 2021, the TRF4 (through a decision from the reporting judge) suspended the lower court decision to transfer the case and returned the case to the Federal District Court of Curitiba.

The Court found that this case has as its central objective to put pressure on the legislative and executive branches to ensure a stable climate. The ecological hotspots case, on the other hand, addresses matters related to environmental law, and does not have a central theme linked to Brazilian climate legislation.

Furthermore, the decision called for a conciliation hearing and judgment of the case to be scheduled within 30 days and for the parties, the Attorney General's Office and the Federal Public Ministry to be summoned regarding the date and time of the hearing.

The plaintiffs request that the National Climate Change Policy be updated according to the best available science, the seriousness of the climate emergency, and the latest IPCC report (AR6) to ensure the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by the Brazilian government consistent with a 1.5oC global warming scenario. The plaintiffs assert that climate change affects the constitutionally recognized right to a healthy environment, as well as fundamental rights such as the right to life, dignity, health, food, and housing, along with several recognized principles of international environmental law.

On December 2020, the government presented its updated NDC. The new NDC used the same percentage of emissions reductions, but altered the baseline quantity for calculating them, effectively making the second NDC less ambitious than the first. Additionally, Brazil had committed to reducing deforestation by 80% by 2030 in 2015 – this provision was deleted from the updated NDC.

In response, the company alleged that the applicant filed 35 actions identical to the present one and that the São Paulo State Court of Justice (TJSP), by design, recognized the ineptitude of 26 of the initial petitions and expressed the merits of the action in only one of the cases, case 224.01.2010.082070-8, proposed against EMIRATES AIRLINES, having dismissed the remaining requests.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The company argued (i) its passive illegitimacy, given that it performs its activity in accordance with the determinations of the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), and cannot be held responsible for complying with what is authorized and imposed by the Public Power; and (ii) legal impossibility of the request since there would be no illegal activity practiced by the Defendant.

The action was registered in the TRF-3 under the Civil Appeal number 0046991-68.2012.4.03.9999. Within the scope of the appeal, the TRF-3 decided to dismiss it, following the understanding of the court of origin, which understood that there was an environmental licensing process already carried out for Guarulhos Airport and authorization for the landing and take-off activity drawn up by ANAC . From this ruling, the MPSP filed a Special Appeal (REsp 1,856,031/SP) with the STJ, where there was a monocratic decision that followed the position of the court of origin in order to emphasize the specific regulation of the activity by ANAC and its efforts in terms of regarding the measurement and mitigation of emissions by the airline industry. It was understood that there would be no need to talk about an illicit act practiced by the business company (or even pollution), with the MPSP intending to impose an unforeseen regulation. After the decision, the REsp was written off to the court of origin. The present case is one among others similar proposed by the MPSP against more than 30 airlines that operated at São Paulo International Airport."

According to Conectas, this is the world's first civil climate action against a national development bank. Although BNDESPar, which is publicly owned, follows an Environmental and Social Policy for Operating in Capital Markets, which bans support for companies with a track record of environmental crimes and modern-day slavery, this policy does not include climate criteria. The company also does not report the carbon emissions associated with its investment portfolio and still maintains equity positions in sectors that are among the most carbon-intensive in the Brazilian economy. The lack of rules or protocols for assessing the impacts of its investments on the climate crisis are in violation of the Brazil's commitments under the Paris Agreement and the country’s own PNMC (National Policy on Climate Change), among other provisions.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Based on two technical opinions, Conectas asks the court to require BNDESPar and its controller, BNDES, to be given 90 days to adopt transparency measures and present a plan with rules and mechanisms to commit their investments and divestments to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the companies they finance. In practice, these actions will affect the just transition and guarantee the country's readjustment in the world economy towards sustainable development, which would be the institutional mission of BNDES itself. The plan should align with commitments to reducing GHG emissions by 2030 in the sectors currently financed by the company, in accordance with the international commitments assumed by Brazil. In addition to presenting concrete goals, the plan should be prepared together with civil society, public bodies and academics, and it should provide for environmental and social compensation whenever the targets are not achieved. The case also calls for the creation by BNDESPar of a Climate Situation Room to assess compliance with the targets established in the plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while publishing the progress or setbacks in the sectors that have investments from BNDESPar.

The action challenges Law 14.182/2021, which deals with the privatization of the national electricity company Eletrobras and promotes changes in the Brazilian electricity sector regime. The law derived from a provisional measure, which can only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. The plaintiffs argue that the provisional measure, which was then turned into the law in question, lacked the requirement of urgency, circumventing the regular legislative process. They claim that, when considering the conversion of the provisional measure, the National Congress approved amendments that resulted in substantial changes to Brazilian energy planning. The final wording of the provisions reveals an undue attempt to prevent a possible veto by the President of the Republic. The Law, under the terms approved, requires the mandatory contracting of energy from small hydroelectric power plants and natural gas thermoelectric plants. The plaintiffs argue that such a requirement makes the necessary decarbonization of the Brazilian energy matrix more distant and will lead to an increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), in breach of the commitments made under the Paris Agreement and by the President of the Republic at COP26. The plaintiffs point out that the enactment of the Law violates the legal and constitutional order since it is contrary to the duty to act in favor of the protection of intact and stable climatic conditions.

The plaintiff challenges State Decree 41,318/2008, which establishes the Energy Compensation Mechanism (ECM) as part of the Greenhouse Gas Emission Abatement Plan, in order to combat global warming and strengthen the energy supply in the State.<br><br></div><div>The decree imposes conditions for obtaining environmental permitting aimed specifically at companies in the energy sector based on fossil fuels, at the state level. The plaintiff states that the planned changes would demand high financial costs, excessively burdening the associated plants. It alleges a breach of the federal government's competence to legislate on electric energy. It further argues that the decree is unconstitutional due to a lack of a previous law to be regulated. It also adds a request for suspension of the effectiveness of the decree. This is based on the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), which, as argued by the plaintiffs, supervened the decree, emphasizing that the national law does not establish any compensation for the energy sector. It clarifies that Brazil has internalized the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC (enacted by Decree 2652/1998), but has made a reservation regarding Annex I, so that it is outside the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ABRAGET argues that the mitigation commitment provided for in the PNMC is voluntary, and not linked to the environmental permitting process. It requests (i) the granting of anticipation of the effects to suspend the effects of the decree and (i) at the end, the judicial determination for the State of Rio de Janeiro to refrain from enforcing Decree 41.318/2008.<br><br></div><div>In response, the defendant State pointed out on November 29, 2013 that the energy compensation mechanism was edited to mitigate and compensate for the scientifically unequivocal adverse environmental effects of energy production. It emphasized the common competence of the federative entities for the adoption of environmental protective measures, and that the member state observed the precautionary principle. The state argued that as thermoelectric plants are more polluting, the discrimination adopted by the State is in accordance with the reality of the facts, and the measure is proportional. The state argued that the decree was not incompatible with the PNMC. Finally, among other issues, it defended the legality and constitutionality of the decree and requested the dismissal of the plaintiff's request.<br><br></div><div>On March 6, 2015, the trial court dismissed the plaintiff's request, emphasizing that the judiciary, when carrying out control of public policies, must honor the purposes of the state, given that the decree contributes to the intergenerational maintenance of a healthy environment. The plaintiff appealed reaffirming the points of the initial petition and requested the annulment of the decision. On February 7, 2017, the appellate court considered the evidence of decree's unconstitutionality to be strong, raising an incident of unconstitutionality to be resolved before the Court's Special Body.<br><br></div><div>On September 12, 2017, within the scope of the claim of unconstitutionality, the Court's Special Body decided for the validity of the decree, emphasizing, among other issues, that it is an activity inherent to the environmental administrative function with a view to materializing protective measures for the environment. After the decision, the plaintiff stated that the discussion on the application of the decree to ABRAGET's associates remained. A decision was handed down stating that the appellant's claim - to determine the non-application of Decree 41.318/08 to its associates - is generic, not being possible to fulfil the request. In addition, the court stated that any assessment of the improper application of conditions to the contracts in force should be carried out in a separate action. Therefore, the author's appeal was dismissed.<br><br></div><div>Subsequently, ABRAGET filed an Extraordinary Appeal, which was held inadmissible.

Since it would be necessary to go through the factual-evidence review and the interpretation of local legislation to verify that the decree refers to environmental protection standards, and not electricity, it could not hear the case.<br><br></div><div>The plaintiffs further filed an Interlocutory Appeal, which was denied by the 2nd Panel of the Court.

The revoked resolutions regulated the permitting of irrigation activities and the definitions of permanent preservation areas (APPs) - a protected area within private properties - in artificial reservoirs, mangroves and sandbanks. Furthermore, it questions the new CONAMA Resolution 499/2020, which changed the permitting of waste processing activities in rotary kilns, revoking the CONAMA Resolution 264/1999. The plaintiff argues that (i) the burning of pesticides, (ii) the APPs and (iii) the modification of the form of environmental permitting for irrigation and burning of toxic waste are against environmental protection efforts.<br><br></div><div>The plaintiff claims that there is a violation of the fundamental right to an ecologically balanced environment, in view of the setback in norms that controlled activities with potential environmental degradation or potential increase in the waste of natural resources. No regulation aiming at the same ends of environmental protection was presented to replace the revoked norms, evidencing the socio-environmental setback with consequences that the authors claim will be felt by current and future generations regarding the water, climate and pollution agendas in a systemic way. When questioning the repeal of Resolution 303/2002, which deals with the protection of mangroves and sandbanks on the Brazilian coast as APPs, The plaintiff highlights its consequences for climate change. It argues that the restinga and mangrove areas contribute to carbon sequestration, being important for mitigating climate change, and helping reduce the vulnerability of the coastal zone, which are the areas most affected by these changes, demonstrating its importance for adaptation. The plaintiff emphasizes that the legal protection of these areas is necessary to enable, among other benefits, the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition, it reinforces the importance of CONAMA Resolution 303/2002 due to the special protection granted to the Atlantic Forest, especially with regard to restingas.

Subsequently, CAPG and the Comunidade da Aldeia Guarani Guajayvi joined the claim as plaintiffs. The plaintiffs ask the court to suspend and cancel the environmental permitting process for the Guaíba Mina Project, led by Copelmi, considered the largest open-pit coal project in the country. The authors claim that there is non-compliance with legal norms and omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), as well as the absence of prior, free and informed consultation with the indigenous people of the Poty Guarani Indigenous Association, especially the Aldeia (TeKoá) Guajayvi of the MByá Guarani people, located in Charqueadas/RS, less than 3 kilometers from the project site. When the case was filed, the project was in the preliminary permitting phase with FEPAM. According to the Consultation Notices referring to the environmental impact assessment, four public hearings were held. After the first two hearings, the period for sending public comments related to the project began. The authors allege that Aldeia Guajayvi submitted a request to submit comments, but was not heard. The plaintiffs therefore intend to prevent the development of the environmental permitting procedure while there is no proper assessment of the technical and locational feasibility of the project, including considering the State Policy on Climate Change (State Law 13,594/2010).<br><br></div><div>The plaintiffs claim that coal mining generates relevant social and environmental impacts to nearby communities, and can cause irreparable environmental damage to these populations, especially due to atmospheric emissions of methane gas, spills and leaks of GHG, effluents and contamination of surface and underground waters, acid mine drainage, among others. They understand that national and international norms relating to indigenous rights have been violated, especially Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). In this sense, they argue that the absence of consultation with the indigenous community leads to the nullity of the EIA, requiring the suspension of the permitting process and subsequent annulment, so that specific consultation protocols are installed for the indigenous people who inhabit the region. They further claim that the Guaíba Mine will directly and permanently affect the indigenous community, violating their rights established by the constitution and international standards, generating several impacts. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants did not adopt measures aimed at allowing the maintenance of the indigenous community's ways of life. Further, FUNAI remained silent throughout the process, since it did not adopt preventive measures to safeguard the regular compliance with the permitting procedure, or support the indigenous people in the defense of their interests. The plaintiffs requested an injunction to immediately suspend of the permitting process until the final judgment. On the merits, they required the declaration of nullity of the permitting process.<br><br></div><div>On February 21, 2020, the court of first instance granted the injunction and suspended the environmental permitting process, until the analysis by FUNAI of the Study of the Indigenous Component (ECI) is included in the EIA, prior to the issuance of an eventual permit by FEPAM, due to the following main reasons: (i) the continuity of the Project's licensing procedure without the inclusion of the ECI in the EIA and the lack of hearing from the affected indigenous communities will cause irreparable damage, based on ILO Convention 169; (ii) FEPAM should have asked FUNAI opine on the permit before issuing the permit, as there was no analysis by the ECI and prior hearing of the affected indigenous communities; (iii) FEPAM, before issuing the permit, must await the preparation and analysis of the ECI, as well as prior, free and informed consultation with the affected indigenous communities.<br><br></div><div>On November 4, 2020, Copelmi filed a defense alleging, preliminarily, that (i) the request does not logically follow from the cause of action, which would give rise to the termination of the permitting process and that (ii) there is a lack of interest on the part of the plaintiffs. The company claimed that there was still no pronouncement from FEPAM regarding the environmental feasibility of the project and that, therefore, the agency has not yet decided on the possible granting of a permit. It argued that the case seeks to interrupt the evaluation by FEPAM and transfer to the judiciary the analysis of the merit of the environmental permitting process. The company further claimed that the damages presented by the authors do not exist and that part of them were contemplated and incorporated in the permitting, and FUNAI issued the terms of reference to carry out an ECI. In addition, it stressed that the only indigenous land around the project would be more than 8 km from the site, with no need for FUNAI to participate in the permitting conducted by FEPAM, nor for ECI to be carried out. However, after FUNAI confirmed the need for its participation and the preparation of an ECI, the company continued with the procedure. Therefore, it observed the prior consultation provided for in ILO Convention 169. Moreover, it stated that the process is still in the early permitting phase, and there can be no claim on the nullity of the permit. Finally, it requested: (i) the dismissal of the process without judgment on the merits, due to the ineptitude of the initial petition and lack of procedural interest; and (ii) the dismissal of the request. FEPAM, on the other hand, contested the claim and stated that there was no reason to be a defendant, since it does not oppose the intervention of FUNAI or an indigenous community in the permitting process. It claimed that it held two public hearings, which were widely publicized, guaranteeing the participation of interested parties. It highlighted that it has not yet concluded the analysis of the EIA presented by Copelmi. It defended the regularity of the project's environmental permitting process and the absence of environmental damage resulting from the project. It reinforced that there was no opposition regarding the participation of indigenous groups or the elaboration of the ECI. Finally, it requested the dismissal of the process without judgment on the merits in relation to FEPAM and that the demand against the agency to be dismissed.<br><br></div><div>FUNAI claimed it intervened in the permitting process to protect the interests of indigenous peoples, and it was not possible to allege an omission. It highlighted that, in April 2020, the terms of reference for the preparation of the ECI was forwarded to FEPAM. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, entry into indigenous lands was suspended. It requested (i) the recognition of its illegitimacy as a defendant, with the extinction of the process without resolution of the merits, and (ii), on the merits, the recognition that there was no omission by FUNAI in monitoring the licensing.<br><br></div><div>On February 8, 2022, the federal court of Rio Grande do Sul handed down a ruling. The upheld the requests of the Arayara Association of Education and Culture and the Poty Guarani Indigenous Association to declare the nullity of the Mina Guaíba Project permitting process, ratifying the decision on the injunction. It rejected the preliminary allegations of incompetence of the Federal Court, of lack of procedural interest of the plaintiffs and of illegitimacy of FUNAI as a defendant. On the merits, the Court recognized the rights of indigenous communities to participate in decisions that may affect their way of life and culture. It concluded that the project's permitting process is already at an advanced stage, having carried out an EIA that disregards the existence of an indigenous community and that there was no participation in the discussions. It understood that the mere formal manifestation of FUNAI does not meet the need for hearing from the indigenous community potentially affected by the activity to be authorized. Thus, it accepted the plaintiff's requests to declare the nullity of the licensing process for the Mina Guaíba project.<br><br>"

The project is the largest open pit coal mine in Brazil, with a high potential for water pollution. The plaintiff points out flaws in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project, neglecting to comply with important permitting phases, such as holding public hearings in affected communities. The plaintiff claims that the project poses a risk of pollution, especially to the Jacuí River, which contributes with 86.3% of the average flow of Lake Guaíba, which is responsible for supplying drinking water to several municipalities. It highlights the need to analyze the extent of possible environmental damage resulting from the undertaking and the synergies with other infrastructures designed for the region. It also argues that the Guaíba Mine Project will impact the balance of water resources, which is inextricably linked to climate change, and thus mobilizes the National Policy on Climate Change – PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). Therefore, actions such as pollution of springs, diversion of water courses, lowering of water tables, drainage of aquifers, among other harmful measures related to the Project, are directly or indirectly related to climate change.

The case is supported by Instituto Internacional Arayara de Educação e Cultura (Instituto Internacional Arayara) as amicus curiae. The case questions the constitutionality of articles 1 to 7 of Federal Law 14,299/2022, which establishes an economic subsidy to small-scale public service concessionaires and creates the Just Energy Transition Program (TEJ). The applicants claim that the articles extend the contracting of electricity generated by the Jorge Lacerda Thermoelectric Complex (CTJL) with subsidies from consumers for another 15 years from 2025, which includes the purchase of energy from the burning of coal and fossil fuels. Considering that the CTJL is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the southern region of Brazil, the applicants allege that there is a violation of the Federal Constitution and the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017), as well as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). They emphasize that the use of coal for energy generation is responsible for socio-environmental disasters in the region, exacerbation of climate change and damage to public health, especially in relation to populations that are already subject to socioeconomic disadvantages. They argue that the TEJ makes it possible to extend the operation of the CTJL until at least 2040. Further, the norm has not presented guidelines for the reduction of GHG by the Complex. On the contrary, the TEJ stated that there will be no abatement of carbon dioxide. Finally, the applicants argue that the composition established for the TEJ Council violates the principles of participatory democracy and equality, as there is no equalization of the number of seats allocated to government and civil society organizations and its composition does not reflect the participation of actors related to environmental and labor causes and the sustainable closure of mines.

The plaintiff alleges that, when editing the new Decree, the Union did not present technical or political reasons for the repeal of the previous rule. Furthermore, the decree can cause irreversible environmental damage to the Amazon biome and the ecosystem services produced by the forest, which implies potential national and global impacts, especially regarding the service of climate regulation and rain distribution.

It seeks to prevent the implementation of the Carbon Chemical Complex in the State as well as the State Policy on Mineral Coal. The MPRS questions the lack of popular participation, especially through public hearings, in the legislative process of State Law 15.047/2017, which authorized the construction of the Carbon Chemical Pole and created the State Policy for Mineral Coal. In addition, it argues that there should be a prior Environmental Impact Assessment (EIS) for the implementation of the Pole, considering the climate impacts of the activities on the site, which will be placed in the complexes of Baixo Jacuí and Campanha, and a Strategic Environmental Assessment before its institution, which must consider the synergistic and global effects of all the activities. The author adds that the policy encourages the use of a highly impactful energy matrix regarding the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). The MPRS emphasizes the proximity of the carbon-chemical complexes to protected areas and cities. The author alleges that the implementation of the Pole considers only the EIS specific to the Guaíba Mine, not taking into account the entire complex. It argues that the State Law does not consider, among other issues, environmental protection, at odds with the federal and state legislation on climate change. The granting of an injunction is required to prevent, among other measures, (i) the implementation of the State Policy on Mineral Coal and the establishment of the Pole and (ii) the issuance of an environmental license for an enterprise inserted in complexes, up to the realization of public hearings and the development of an EIS and a Strategic Environmental Assessment, prior to the implementation of the Carbon Chemical Pole and the State Policy on Mineral.

It states that deforestation causes irreparable damage to the Amazon Rainforest and affects the rights and way of life of the traditional extractivist community, which is based on the sustainable exploitation of natural resources. The action emphasizes that the Chico Mendes Extraction Reserve (RESEx) is an instrument of social justice and a vehicle for forest protection. It claims that the advance of deforestation has occurred due to the weakening of public policies, land invasion, road construction, density of access roads, and fires in the region, among other reasons. According to the plaintiff, beginning in 2019, there has been a drastic increase in deforestation. The RESEx Utilization Plan states that deforestation in areas with rubber plantations cannot exceed 10% of the area, and the action claims that this limit has been exceeded in approximately half of those areas. The IEA emphasizes that RESEx has a strategic role in providing environmental services to the inhabitants of the Acre River basin due to the supply of water. It also highlights the deforestation reduction targets for the Legal Amazon region in the Amazon Deforestation Prevention and Control Plan (PPCDAm) foreseen in Federal Law 12.187/2009 (National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC)), which, according to the IEA, are not being met. It points out that, as the Federal Union, IBAMA and ICMBio are not fulfilling their duty of management and control and are contributing to the damage to the RESEx and the community. It emphasizes the vital role of the forest in the carbon cycle and that approximately three million tons of carbon were released into the atmosphere due to illegal deforestation in the RESEx. The IEA argues that there is a need for full environmental reparation in addition to the obligation to restore the forest and argues that future studies should be done to calculate the compensation for associated damages, such as climate damage. It emphasizes the vulnerable situation of the community, which justifies the payment of compensation for collective moral damage. It also argues that there is a need to prepare a Forest Restoration and Deforestation Control Plan for the region. Finally, among the other claims, the author requests: (i) payment of compensation for the material damage caused to the environment in the amount of at least R$ 183,817,104.00; (ii) payment of compensation for collective moral damage in the minimum amount of R$ 100,000,000.00; and (iii) immediate forest restoration of the entire area deforested above the established limit, to be carried out according to a Forest Restoration and Deforestation Control Plan."

It states that the former Minister, through actions, omissions, practices, and speeches, promoted the dismantling of environmental policies, favoring unlawful interests in violation of the constitutional principles that guide the Public Administration. The MPF raises a vast set of acts by the former Minister that they allege have contributed to the intentional dismantling of environmental protection, based on four main aspects: (i) regulatory measures; (ii) transparency and participation measures; (iii) budget measures; and (iv) monitoring measures. As for normative dismantling, climate is highlighted regarding the extinction of the Secretariat of Climate Change and Forests. The MPF claiming that such an act would signal that the combating climate change is not a priority of the Federal Government and would distance Brazil from its international and national climate commitments. Regarding the budget dismantling, it questions the reduction of resources allocated to the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and the paralysis of the Amazon Fund due to the extinction of the operational and guiding bodies. The Amazon Fund is dedicated to financing REDD+ actions linked to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and the MPF mentions its paralysis influences in lack of financing and implementation of the Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), provided for in the National Policy on Climate Change – PNMC. The increase in deforestation and the Ministry's lack of action to combat it are associated with the failure to comply with climate commitments and deforestation reduction targets. Given a broad picture of dismantling of the protection of the environment, the MPF requested, as a preliminary injunction, the precautionary removal of Ricardo Salles from the post of Minister of the Environment, with a definitive request that the acts questioned be declared unlawful and as to sentence him to loss of public office.<br><br></div><div>The first instance judge denied the preliminary injunction request.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In its reply, the Federal Government denied the existence of any wrongdoing by the former minister Ricardo Salles.

The court found this approach would exceed the constitutional authority of Parliament and intrude too far into areas of Provincial authority and limit Provincial efforts to deal with GHG emissions.

The Court wrote that ""Canada has adduced evidence that clearly shows that establishing minimum national standards of GHG price stringency to reduce GHG emissions is of sufficient concern to Canada as a whole that it warrants consideration in accordance with the national concern doctrine."" Provinces were incapable of addressing the problem in the same way because they could not set a national minimum GHG price, and ""a failure to include one province in the scheme would jeopardize its success in the rest of Canada."" Further, the Court found that the GGPPA had a limited effect on provincial jurisdiction because it was limited to a narrow regulatory mechanism of pricing, not regulation of all aspects of GHG emissions, and because it only acts as a backstop if provincial pricing is found insufficient."

The Court wrote, ""[t]he issue of climate change, while undoubtedly important, is inherently political, not legal, and is of the realm of the executive and legislative branches of government."" The Court further found that because plaintiffs did not reference specific sections of laws that cause specific breaches of Charter rights, their claims presented no reasonable cause of action.

In May 2019, the Ontario Legislature enacted the Federal Carbon Tax Transparency Act, which required that a notice explaining certain fuel charges be posted on every gas pump in every gas station in Ontario. The notice stated ""the federal carbon tax will cost you,"" with a graph showing costs to consumers rising through 2022. Corporation of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) brought suit seeking a declaration that the legislation violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.<br><br></div><div>The Court concluded that CCLA had public interest standing to bring the action, particularly because the group had tried to find a gas retailer to act as a co-plaintiff. The Court then concluded that the required notice adversely affected expression. Moreover, the Court reasoned, the notice was ""inaccurate in a way that the Ontario government well knows"" because the carbon pricing act serves a regulatory rather than a revenue-raising purpose, and so it is not a tax. Finally, the Court held that the notice's infringement on free speech was not justified because it served more to advance a partisan message than to share information with the public. The Court ordered the gas retailers may but do not need to keep the notices on their fuel pumps."

Alberta, 2021 ABQB 3).<br><br></div><div>The plaintiffs have a royalty interest in coal produced from the Genesee Coal Mine in Alberta, which is dedicated to fueling the Genesee Power Plant. The plant generates coal-fired electricity for the City of Edmonton and elsewhere. The plaintiffs paid, collectively, $460 million for the royalty interest in the coal at the mine.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In 2012, the federal government adopted the Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-Fired Generation of Electricity Regulations (“2012 Regulations”) aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity plants, which did not directly bind the Genesee Power Plant at the time. The 2012 Regulations permitted the plant to operate as it was from an emissions perspective until its power plant units would be deemed to end their useful life (estimated to be in 2039, 2044 and 2055) under the 2012 Regulations. The plaintiffs claimed that because the 2012 Regulations permitted the units to operate as they were from an emissions perspective for 50 years from their commissioning dates, a reduction in that ability entitled the plaintiffs to compensation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In 2015, the government of Alberta introduced its “Climate Leadership Plan” which aimed to phase out emissions from coal-fired electricity generation by 2030. The government of Alberta entered into an off-coal agreement with the owners of the Genesee Power Plant, where the owners agreed to end emissions from coal-fired electricity generation by 2030 and, in return, the government of Alberta agreed to pay certain transition payments. The plaintiffs alleged that by entering into the agreement with the Genesee Power Plant owners, the government of Alberta engaged in conduct that compensated the plant owners but excluded the plaintiffs.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In 2018, new federal regulations came into force amending the 2012 Regulations (the “2018 Regulations”). The 2018 Regulations affected existing plants, including the Genesee Power Plant, and required that they meet the new emissions standards set out in the regulation by December 31, 2029. The plaintiffs alleged that, based on the 2012 Regulations, the plaintiffs had counted upon the royalty stream being available to 2039, 2044 and 2055. The plaintiffs alleged that the 2018 Regulations amounted to a constructive expropriation or “taking” by the federal government of its royalty interest in the coal after 2030.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Master found that the 2012 Regulations, as amended by the 2018 Regulations, was not a “taking” by the federal government and that the actions of the government of Alberta to enter into an off-coal agreement (and other actions) compensating the Genesee Power Plant owners did not amount to takings or actionable wrongs. These actions therefore did not create a cause of action in favour of the plaintiffs. For those reasons, the Master dismissed the plaintiffs’ actions.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In reviewing the Master’s decision to grant summary dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claim for de facto expropriation, the Court determined whether the defendants had met the requirements for a finding of a de facto taking requiring compensation at common law: (i) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it and (ii) removal of all reasonable uses of the property. The Court found that the requirements had not been met, as there was no evidence that the defendants would, in some way, recover a freehold interest in the coal and that the defendants have an interest in keeping the coal in the ground (in its natural state). The Court found that the defendants’ interest was reducing Canada’s production of greenhouse gas emissions, as manifested in the Paris Agreement and the 2012 Regulations, as amended by the 2018 Regulations. The Court agreed with the Master’s finding that the defendants had proven on a balance of probabilities that there was no merit to the plaintiffs’ claim.<br><br>"

Chile's Energy Sector Decarbonization Plan contains a gradual closure of existing coal-fired power plants at the national level. Coal power plants accounted for 36.7% of energy generation in 2019 and for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. Chile’s goal is to reach carbon neutrality by 2005. As part of the decarbonization agreement, the government launched the process to elaborate a Just Energy Transition Strategy.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Within this process, they initiated the discussion to generate local action plans for communities affected by coal-fired power plants. These local action plans may make it possible to diagnose the existing social, productive, environmental and territorial needs to generate actions resulting from participatory processes, with clear goals, indicators, deadlines and responsible parties. The plan seeks to reintegrate affected workers into the workforce. Furthermore, it creates mechanisms to safeguard the rights of workers during the transition process. However, on December 26, 2020, the Ministry of Energy issued the Supreme Decree No. 42, which ordered the implementation of a plan that ensures the reinsertion or reconversion of workers into the labor market without consulting with workers affected by the decarbonization plan.<br><br></div><div>On January 25, 2021, the three union workers brought a case against the Ministry of Energy.

The ruling considered the closure of coal-fired plants as a part of Chile's Energy Sector Decarbonization Plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The decision specifies that in this context, the agreements adopted by the State of Chile to achieve carbon neutrality require the performance of a just transition strategy both for the workers harmed by the loss of their direct and indirect source of employment and for the communities affected by the loss of services linked to the development of the declining thermoelectric activity, allowing the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy. The lack of consultation was in violation of the government’s obligation to ensure a just transition.

Since then, only the State of Chile can manage lithium production, which maintains the status of lithium as a strategic mineral. On October 13, 2021, the Government of Chile (through the Ministry of Mining) published a call for applications to increase lithium production. This call intends to facilitate the entry of national and foreign companies in the lithium market, promoting production and supporting the development of new technologies that enable the energy transition and the fight against global warming. Lithium is a key element of the energy transition given the increased demand for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for supplying the power and transport sectors with renewable energy. The call seeks encompass exploration, exploitation, and commercialization of a total of 400,000 tons of marketable metallic lithium, divided into 5 quotas of 80,000 tons each.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On January 10, 2022, the regional government of Atacama brought a case against the Ministry of Mining. The complaint questions the bidding process of the lithium production application, which the regional government argues was carried out without public participation and in the absence of any assessment of the activity’s potential environmental impacts on the region. The regional government argues that the project will be developed in the Atacama Salt Flats, representing a threat to its biodiversity. Atacama also points out that the project might destroy wetlands, the availability of water, which is already scarce in the area, and the destruction of cultural heritage, as it is a sector of high touristic interest. While the regional government recognizes that the call for lithium bidding responds to international pressure to guarantee an energy transition, it highlights the preliminary step to assess the impacts of the increased lithium mining. The regional authority requests that the contracts are deemed null or, in the alternative, to restart the bidding process and ensure that the regional government is properly consulted.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Ministry of Mining argued that the bids have already been awarded to two companies and that the existing contracts refer to the exploration and exploitation of lithium.

The court noted several important features of paramos, including their fragility, their lack of regulatory protection, their role in providing Colombia with as much as 70 percent of its drinking water, and the capacity of their soils and vegetation to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The court highlighted the last of these features in particular, calling pa?ramos a ""carbon capture system"" and explaining that a paramos' carbon capture capacity exceeds that of a comparably-sized tropical rainforest. Law No. 1450 of 2011 established Colombia's National Development Plan 2010–2014, and Law No. 1753 of 2015 established its 2014–2018 successor. Two provisions in the latter law are especially notable here. The first of these authorizes the Commission on Intersectoral Infrastructure and Strategic Projects to designate particular projects as being in the national strategic interest—a designation that exempts projects from aspects of local regulatory oversight. The second provision prohibits various activities—agriculture, mining, oil and gas exploration and refining—in paramos, but only if project owners received a lease and environmental permit for mining after February 9, 2010 or for oil and gas operations after June16, 2011. Thus the law authorizes projects that received permits prior to those dates.

These norms establish the criteria and requirements to perform fracking in Colombia. The petitioner argued that the challenged norms allowed fracking in Colombia, despite the significant number of scientific studies that substantiate fracking’s adverse and irreversible effects on human health and environmental stability.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On July 7, 2022, the Council of State decided against the plaintiffs’ claims. The court found that there was no violation of the Constitution or Law 99 of 1993 and declared the challenged norms valid. The court considered that fracking was already authorized by other existing and valid norms and that the challenged acts were merely contributing to its regulation. The court reasoned that all fracking-related norms should be interpreted holistically and comprehensively, preventing the court from declaring, as argued by the plaintiff, that the challenge acts were insufficient or inadequate. The court decided that the challenged acts complemented the criteria and requirement to perform fracking. The court restricted the legal analysis to the possible contradiction of superior norms that could undermine the validity of the acts. However, the court concluded that this contradiction was not proved during trial.<br><br></div><div>The court explicitly invoked the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, among other norms, and stated that the precautionary principle is crucial for the protection of the climate system in benefit of future and present generations. Moreover, the decision mentions that according to the expert witnesses and reports, fracking, and fossil fuel exploitation in general prevent Colombia from reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributing to the fight against climate change. Nevertheless, the court considered the challenged acts did not violate this principle. According to the court, the precautionary principle does not mean “zero risk scenarios”, rather controlled scenarios to reach environmental and economic development goals. In the court’s opinion, the challenged acts are part of a broader set of norms that regulate fracking in Colombia in a way that does not contradict any superior norm.<br><br>"

The Court ruled that the state’s failure to take sufficient GHG mitigation measures is unlawful and that the state should abstain from continuing to infringe the plaintiffs’ rights by such failure. The court derived the obligation to mitigate climate change from the Paris Agreement and the EU Climate Law (which sets the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990), as the Czech Republic does not have a climate act yet. State authorities are obliged to have a plan of precise and complete measures to achieve this goal, which is not yet set in place. While the Court concluded that the goals of the Paris Agreement (of keeping the increase in global temperatures below 2oC) is not legally binding, the national contribution of the Czech Republic cannot be avoided. Avoiding these climate goals would threaten the plaintiff's constitutionally guaranteed rights.

The support scheme provided direct income support to farmers, however it was amended such that all direct payments beyond a certain amount should be reduced by a certain percentage each year.  The savings made through these reductions would then be used to finance measures under the rural development policy, in light of the ""new and demanding challenges"" faced by the agriculture sector, ""such as climate change and the increasing importance of bio-energy, as well as the need for better water management and more effective protection of biodiversity.""  The Preamble also noted that Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the EU and its member states are called upon to ""adapt its policies in the light of climate change considerations.""
The Court reviewed two issues: (1) whether a new provision to the Regulation to reduce the amount of direct payments to farmers was valid, against an existing provision that already set the amount, in light of the principle of protecting legitimate expectations; (2) and whether a four percent increase for farmers with larger holdings exceeding 300,000 euros violates the principle of non-discrimination.

The Court, confirming an earlier decision of its advocate general, rejected the claim, holding that the EU has the right to permit a commercial activity, in this instance air transport, to be carried out in its territory only on the condition that operators comply with the criteria that have been established by the EU. The court rejected the argument by the airlines that the ETS could not apply to flights that mostly take place outside of EU territory.

Several features of the ETS are critical to the case: some allowances are auctioned to emitters and others are given away for free; there are a fixed proportion of free allowances, which are granted only to firms that face competition from non-EU firms a category that excludes electricity generators; the process for calculating the number of allowances ""auctioned and free"" begins with member states' submission of emission sources and estimated volumes; responding to members states' overestimation of the allowances due to their industrial firms, the European Commission issued Decisions in 2011 and 2013 to govern the calculation of a ""correction factor.""&nbsp;<br><br>The Court found that the European Commission's 2013 Decision established a ""correction factor"" calculation that ignored relevant information, and on that basis instructed the Commission to revise its approach by March 2017.

Nordzucker's emissions report excluded emissions resulting from steam generation necessary to operate the refinery's drying facility on the basis of a letter from a German Ministry stating that such facilities were exempted from compulsory emissions trading schemes. An expert verified the report, and Nordzucker surrendered emissions allowances equal to the emissions stated in the report. Subsequently, the German Emissions Trading Authority examined Nordzucker's emissions report and found that it should have included emissions attributable to the refinery's drying facility. Nordzucker revised its emissions report and surrendered additional allowances. German authorities found Nordzucker liable for failing to timely surrender emissions allowances and levied a penalty as provided in Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87. After a series of appeals, the German Federal Administrative Court referred to the European Court of Justice the question whether excess emissions penalties apply where an operator surrenders allowances equal to emissions stated in a verified report, but where the report is later found to understate the operator's emissions and additional allowances are surrendered.

Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, the Court decided to reopen the oral procedure and called on the parties to set out their views on the possible consequences to be drawn from that fact and, in particular, from the entry into force of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU in the context of the present proceedings.&nbsp;<br><br>In the context of an action for damages seeking compensation for the damage allegedly suffered by the applicant in consequence of the adoption of that directive, the Court held that the Community legislature enjoys broad discretion when exercising its powers in the field of environmental issues under Article 174 EC and Article 175 EC. The exercise of that discretionary power implies the need for the Community legislature to anticipate and evaluate ecological, scientific, technical and economic changes of a complex and uncertain nature and the weighing up and arbitration by that legislature of the various objectives, principles and interests set out in Article 174 EC. That is reflected in Directive 2003/87/EC in the establishment of a series of objectives and sub-objectives which are in part contradictory. When the Community legislature is called on to restructure or establish a complex scheme, such as the allowance trading scheme, it is entitled to have recourse to a step-by-step approach and to carry out only a progressive harmonisation of the national legislation at issue.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court stressed that, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity, European Union legislation in the sphere of environmental protection does not seek to effect complete harmonisation, the Member States being free to adopt more stringent protective measures, subject only to the conditions that those be compatible with the EC Treaty and be notified to the Commission. The mere fact that the Community legislature left open a particular question falling within the scope of Directive 2003/87/EC and of a fundamental freedom does not in itself justify that omission's being classified as contrary to the rules of the Treaty. In addition, the implementation of Directive 2003/87/EC being subject to review by the national courts, it is incumbent upon those courts, if they should encounter difficulties relating to the interpretation or validity of that directive, to refer a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. Last, the applicant claimed that Directive 2003/87/EC infringes the principle of legal certainty, because there is no provision governing the extent of the financial consequences which may result from both a possible insufficiency of allowances allocated to an installation and the price of those allowances, that price being determined exclusively by the market forces which came into being following the establishment of the allowance trading scheme.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court found that regulation of the prices of allowances might thwart the main objective of Directive 2003/87/EC, which is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through an efficient allowance trading scheme in which the cost of emissions and investments made to reduce such emissions is essentially determined by market forces. In the event of an insufficiency of allowances, the incentive for operators to reduce, or not to reduce, their greenhouse gas emissions will depend on a complex economic decision taken in the light of the price of emission allowances available on the exchange market and of the costs of possible measures to reduce emissions which may aim either to reduce production or to invest in more efficient methods of production in terms of energy output.<br><br>In such a scheme, the increase in the cost of emissions cannot be regulated in advance by the legislature without reducing, or even completely removing, the economic incentives which constitute its very basis and thereby adversely affecting the effectiveness of the allowance trading scheme. The fact that it is not possible to predict how the exchange market will develop constitutes an element inherent in and inseparable from the economic mechanism characterising the allowance trading scheme subject to the classic rules of supply and demand and cannot be contrary to the principle of legal certainty."

On 7 July 2004, the Commission adopted Decision C(2004) 2515/4 final concerning the national allocation plan for the allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances notified by the United Kingdom. Subsequently, the United Kingdom notified the Commission that it wished to amend its NAP. The United Kingdom proposed, in particular, to increase the total quantity of allowances to 756.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. However, the Commission indicated that it considered that the proposed amendments were inadmissible. The United Kingdom applied to the Court of First Instance requesting the infringement of the Directive and of the Decision of 7 July 2004. It stated that the NAP in question was expressly provisional and that this had been acknowledged by the Commission. The Commission contested that it had been of the view that the NAP, including the figures relating to the total quantity of allowances, had been complete. The Commission added that any amendment exceeding the total quantity of allowances was expressly excluded as Commission decisions on NAPs had to provide certainty, both for the coherence of the emissions trading system overall and in order for the allowance market to function properly, as market price building depended strongly on the utmost stability of the total quantity of allowances. Otherwise, the risk of having a series of consultations and new Commission decisions would arise. The market for allowances, being reliant on the stability of the total quantity of allowances, would be undermined and unable to function properly with such a degree of uncertainty. The court noted that in the contested decision, the Commission rejected as inadmissible the amendments of the NAP proposed by the United Kingdom because they would have resulted in the total quantity of allocated quotas exceeding the quantity authorized by the Commission in its Decision of 7 July 2004. Therefore, the Commission did not consider itself obliged to carry out any examination of the proposed amendments on their merits. In order to decide whether the Commission was entitled to reject those amendments as inadmissible, the court examined the roles and powers allocated to the Commission and the Member States respectively under the Directive, particularly those in Articles 9, 10 and 11. It concluded that the amendments of the NAP were not limited in the way expressed by the Commission. This followed necessarily from the fact that the Member State was obliged, in accordance with Article 11(1) of and paragraph 9 of Annex III to the Directive, to take account of comments received from the public after the initial notification of the NAP and before the adoption of the definitive decision under Article 11(1) of the Directive. If amendments to the NAPs, made after the expiry of the three-month period mentioned in Article 9(3) of the Directive or after a decision of the Commission, were limited in the way described by the Commission, then that public consultation would be deprived of its effectiveness and the comments of the public would be rendered purely academic. It also had to be pointed out that the purpose of the Directive was to establish an efficient European market in greenhouse gas emission allowances, with the least possible diminution of economic development and employment. Therefore, even though the Directive aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in accordance with the commitments under the Kyoto Protocol, that aim had to be achieved, in so far as possible, while respecting the needs of the European economy. It followed that the NAPs developed under the Directive had to take due account of accurate data relating to emission forecasts for the installations covered by the Directive. If a NAP was based in part on incorrect information relating to the level of emissions in certain sectors, the Member State in question would have to be entitled to propose amendments to the NAP, including increases to the total quantity of allowances to be allocated, in order to address those problems before the market began functioning. The Court therefore considered that it followed both from the wording of the Directive, and from the general structure and objectives of the system which it establishes, that the Commission could not restrict a Member State's right to propose amendments. The Commission also maintained that any amendment increasing the total quantity of allowances had to be excluded because it could have an adverse effect on the stability of the market. The Court considered that this argument has not been substantiated by the Commission. The argument of the Commission that the proposed amendments would have serious repercussions on scarcity and would therefore be likely to have a significant impact on the market price was exaggerated. The United Kingdom proposed to increase the total quantity of allowances from 736 to 756.1 Mt CO2, which was an increase of 2.7%. In light of the fact that this amendment had simultaneously been published by the United Kingdom with a view to obtaining comments of the public, the operators concerned would have been aware of that increase seven weeks before the opening of the market. The argument of the Commission, based on the idea that the stability of the market amounted to an imperative rule, was exaggerated, especially with regard to amendments proposed before the opening of the market and thus it could not be accepted. The court held that the Commission made an error of law in rejecting the amendments proposed by the United Kingdom as inadmissible. Therefore, the single plea raised by the United Kingdom was declared to be well founded and the contested decision was annulled."

However, the ECJ ruled that the coal is essential to the functioning of the power plant and is therefore directly associated with the plant’s activity. Moreover, because the coal’s self-heating emits greenhouse gases, storing coal is an activity that could have an effect on emissions and pollution within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC.

Bitter argued that, because Ziegelwerk Höxter had ceased its business activity before the opening of insolvency procedures in September 2011, it was no longer obliged to report or surrender its emissions allowances for 2011. Instead, she claimed that Ziegelwerk Höxter's contingent liabilities were solely to be registered as claims in the insolvency procedure.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court held that the EU legislature must be allowed broad discretion in applying penalties and that the relatively high level of the penalty is justified by the need to have infringements of the obligation to surrender a sufficient number of allowances treated in a stringent and consistent manner throughout the European Union. The Court also noted that Directive 2003/87 grants operators a reasonable amount of time to comply with their surrender obligations and that the fact that the amount of the fine involved exceeded that of one in a previous case, in which the Court ruled that fines for penalties to surrender are consistent with the principle of proportionality, was irrelevant. In light of the principle of proportionality, the Court ruled, there is nothing in this case that affects the second sentence of Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87, which does provide for a penalty of EUR 100 per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted for which the operator has not surrendered allowances."

The installation in question could not be exempted even if its purpose was to produce electricity for the natural gas processing facility.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court of Justice further determined that Article 3(c) of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU must be interpreted to mean that an installation such as that at issue in the main proceedings is not entitled to be allocated free emission allowances for the heat produced ""where that heat is used for purposes other than the production of electricity, since such an installation does not fulfill the conditions laid down in Article 10a(4) and (8) of the directive."" The activities of natural gas desulphurisation and sulphur recovery did not meet the criteria of those articles. An analyst reviewing the decision noted that if it is followed by EU governments, it could result in thousands of facilities no longer qualifying for free allocation of ghg emission permits and drive up the cost of carbon in the market."

Trinseo applied for free allocation of emission allowances to its installation for the trading period 2013?2020, which the German government denied because polycarbonates do not fall under the list of products approved for free allocation.

Plaintiffs allege that the EU’s existing target to reduce domestic ghg emissions by 40% by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels, is insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change and threatens plaintiffs’ fundamental rights of life, health, occupation, and property.<br><br></div><div>The lawsuit has two major components. First, plaintiffs bring a nullification action, asking the court to declare three EU legal acts as void for failing to set adequate ghg emissions targets. The three EU legal acts are: Directive 2003/87/EC governing emissions from large power generation installations (ETS); regulation 2018/EU on emissions from industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and etc. (ESR); and regulation 2018/EU on emissions from and removals by land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Plaintiffs argue that inadequate emissions reductions violate higher order laws that protect fundamental rights to health, education, occupation, and equal treatment as well as provide obligations to protect the environment. These higher rank laws include: the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (ChFR), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Paris Agreement. Plaintiffs ask the court to order that the three emissions reductions laws remain in force until improved versions of the Acts can be enacted. Art. 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) is the basis for this procedural action.<br><br></div><div>The second action concerns non-contractual liability. Article 340 of the TFEU provides a mechanism for injunctive relief when three conditions are met: 1) there is an unlawful act by the EU institution(s), 2) the unlawful act is a serious breach of a law that protects individual rights, and 3) there is a sufficient causal link between the breach and the damages.<br><br></div><div>Demanded relief is an injunction to compel the EU to set more stringent ghg emissions reductions targets through the existing framework of the ETS, ESR and LULUCF regimes in order to bring the EU into compliance with its legal obligations. Plaintiffs assert this would require a 50%-60% reduction in ghg emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 or whatever level the court finds appropriate.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The European General Court did not rule on the merits, but dismissed the case on procedural grounds, finding that the plaintiffs could not bring the case since they are not sufficiently and directly affected by these policies (“direct and individual concern” criterion). The court concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case because climate change affects every individual in one manner or another and case law requires that plaintiffs are affected by the contested act in a manner that is “peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons, and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually.” The court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the interpretation of the concept of ‘individual concern’ referred to in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU is not compatible with a fundamental right to effective judicial protection under Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Nor did the court find that plaintiffs could bring the case under the other possible criteria under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 of the TFEU which would require that they were direct addressees of the legislative package in question or they contested a regulatory act that was of direct concern to them.<br><br></div><div>The plaintiffs appealed to the European Court of Justice on July 11, 2019, arguing that the EU General Court erred in concluding that plaintiffs lacked standing under Article 263, and by holding that plaintiffs needed to establish standing under Article 263 in order to bring a claim for non-contractual liability.<br><br>On March 25, 2021, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the General Court's order and held the plaintiff's claims inadmissible on standing grounds for failing to demonstrate that they were individually impacted by Europe's climate policy. The ECJ rejected plaintiffs' arguments that the General Court did not take into account the climate harms specific to them. Rather, the ECJ found sufficient the lower court's reasoning that ""the fact that the effects of climate change may be different for one person than they are for another does not mean that, for that reason, there exists standing to bring an action against a measure of general application,"" and that doing so would render standing limitations meaningless. Further, the ECJ rejected the argument that, by invoking an infringement of fundamental rights, the plaintiffs had established standing. ""[T]he appellants’ reasoning, in addition to its generic wording, leads to the conclusion that there is locus standi for any applicant, since a fundamental right is always likely to be concerned in one way or another by measures of general application such as those contested in the present case."" The ECJ thus dismissed the appeal and ordered plaintiffs to pay costs incurred by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU."

The Court found that the financing decision was taken ""under environmental law"" because all acts of public authorities which may violate environmental law, regardless of whether the institution is formed by environmental law, should be subject to internal review. Here the EIB's decision was based on an assessment of whether it met renewable energy goals and therefore impacted environmental law. Further, the Court found that the decision was an ""administrative act"" despite the terms and conditions of the loan not yet being set because it produced definitive legally binding effects on third parties by enabling others to take steps to formalise the loan.<br><br>On April 2, 2021, the EIB appealed the decision with the European Court of Justice. The EIB alleges that the General Court, under the Aarhus Convention, misconstrued the notion of an ‘administrative act’, that the EIB decision to approve the loan does not have ‘legally binding and external effect’, and that the General Court was wrong when it classified the EIB’s decision as ‘adopted under environmental law’.

Within this framework, the European Commission adopted Regulation 2016/646 to set up a procedure for testing the real driving emissions of certain motor vehicles to better reflect the emissions measured on the road. This Regulation was supplemented by Commission Regulation 2016/646, which establishes limits for emissions not to be exceeded during tests.<br><br></div><div>On June 26, June 29, and July 16, 2016, respectively, the City of Paris, the City of Brussels, and the Municipality of Madrid brought an action before the General Court to annul Regulation 2016/646. The cities argued that the regulation would prevent them from imposing restrictions on the circulation of passenger vehicles in relation to their air pollutant emissions. The Commission raised the objection that the contested regulation was not of direct concern to the applicants within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In its judgment of December 13, 2018, the General Court partially upheld the actions and held that the contested regulation was of direct concern to the applicants. The General Court considered the regulation a regulatory act which does not entail implementing measures and which directly affects the cities’ powers to regulate the circulation of motor vehicles. On February 23, 2019, the Commission appealed to the European Court of Justice.<br><br></div><div>On January 13, 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) set aside the judgement of the General Court, in particular the interpretation by the General Court of Directive 2007/46. The ECJ clarified that for the applicants to be directly concerned by the regulation (and therefore, for the action to be admissible), two conditions must be met. First, the contested measure must directly affect the legal situation of the applicant. Secondly, it must leave no discretion to the entity entrusted with the implementation. The ECJ held that the General Court erred when it stated that the cities were prevented from exercising their powers to regulate the circulation of passenger vehicles to reduce pollution.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The disagreement between the General Court and the ECJ revolved around article 4, paragraph 3, second subparagraph of Directive 2007/46, which mentions that member states “shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the registration, sale, entry into service or circulation on the road of vehicles, […] if they satisfy the requirements of the [Directive].” The General Court inferred from the inclusion of the words ‘circulation on the road’ that the Directive restricted the regulatory powers of the local governments to adopt traffic restrictions for vehicles. As a result, the Directive and its implementing acts directly affect the legal position of the cities.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The ECJ, however, ruled that the negative obligation in the second subparagraph of article 4, paragraph 3 must be read together with the first subparagraph. The first subparagraph gives the member states a positive obligation to “register or permit the sale or entry into service only of such vehicles, components and separate technical units as satisfy the requirements of this Directive,” without any mention of circulation on the road. As the two subparagraphs are complementary, the ECJ concluded that the General Court erred when it gave the second subparagraph a broader meaning. As a consequence, the General Court also erred when it derived from this that the cities were directly affected, and thus directly concerned, by the contested Regulation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The ECJ also mentioned that the obligations Directive 2007/46 imposes on Member States only concern placing motor vehicles on the market and not their subsequent use. Moreover, the cities are not liable to infringe on Directive 2007/46 (read together with Commission Regulation 2016/646) solely by adopting environmental protection legislation to limit the local circulation of certain vehicles. Through its judgment, the ECJ clarified that local governments do not violate the EU framework for testing real driving emissions when they adopt low-emission zones.<br><br>"

EU imports constituted 61 percent of Russia’s fossil fuel exports (besides oil and gas also coal) in the first one hundred days of the war. Oil and gas exports are an important part of the Russian economy, the revenues of which make up 45% of Russia’s 2021 budget, according to the International Energy Agency. The imports of Russian oil and gas are governed by Regulation 2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2015 on common rules for imports. Article 1 of that Regulation states that such oil and gas shall be freely imported into the Union and shall not be subject to any quantitative restrictions. To decrease dependence on Russian oil and gas, the European Union has adopted REPowerEU, a plan to rapidly reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels and fast forward the green transition. The plan focuses on saving energy, diversifying energy supplies, accelerating the rollout of renewables, and smart investments. The plan has no specific timeframe to achieve its goals but aims to achieve the reduction ""as soon as possible"" and ""well before 2030,"" 2030 being the target set before the adoption of the plan.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On May 25, 2022, Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), Avaaz, Notre Affairs à Tous, Deutsche Umwelthilfe, and Svitlana Romanko, co-founder of the Stand With Ukraine campaign, filed a complaint with the European Ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, alleging that the EU failed to conduct an impact assessment before continuing its imports from Russia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The complainants contend that the EU is obliged to assess the impact of its oil and gas imports on both human rights and GHG emissions. The complaint states that the EU oil and gas imports are a critical source for Russia to finance its war efforts, thus contributing to the human rights violations it says are happening in Ukraine. At the same time, the complaint states that the Commission has not adequately assessed the implications for climate change of its current and planned measures to reduce Russian oil and gas imports. The complaint mentions that the Commission’s plan to find alternatives for Russian fossil fuels risks locking in fossil fuel use.<br><br></div><div>The content of the assessments is described in detail in a letter sent on April 26, 2022, and attached to the complaint. In that letter, the complaining parties ask the Commission to:<br>- assess the full range of measures that are both available to the EU – including a full cessation of imports of Russian oil and gas – appropriate to ensure that the EU does not contribute to the ability of Russia to prosecute its war of aggression in Ukraine;<br>- examine – and consider other authoritative studies which examine – all available means of rapidly reducing reliance on Russian oil and gas within the EU;<br>- assess the implications for the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions of any measures it considers to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas;<br>- assess how a rapid reduction in the EU’s reliance on Russian oil and gas can be achieved in a manner that is most consistent with the imperative of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br></div><div>The complaint states that the EU is obliged to respect international law in the exercise of its powers and that conducting an impact assessment is part of that obligation. In not conducting such an assessment, the EU has not acted in accordance with the principles of good administrative behavior. The complaint specifically mentions that the EU has violated art. 6 (proportionality) and 9 (objectivity) of the European Code of Good Administrative Behavior.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>After receiving the complaint, it is up to the Ombudsman’s office to determine whether the complaint warrants an inquiry. If the Ombudsman opens an inquiry, she can find that (1) there is no maladministration, (2) make a proposal to the institution to resolve the matter, or (3) find that there is maladministration and make recommendations to address the maladministration.

The software operating the exhaust gas recirculation (‘EGR’) system was programmed in such a way that, under normal conditions of use, the EGR rate was reduced. In its European Comission (EC) type-approval procedure, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, the “KBA”) found that the software constituted a defeat device prohibited by Regulation No 715/2007. Volkswagen updated the software by setting the EGR valve so exhaust gas purification was fully effective only when the outside temperature was greater than 15 °C. The KBA approved that temperature window in its decision of June 20, 2016.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Deutsche Umwelthilfe started a legal proceeding against Germany challenging the software’s authorization before the Administrative Court in Schleswig-Holstein, contending that the approved temperature window constituted a defeat device prohibited by the law of the European Union (EU law). The administrative court decided that Deutsche Umwelthilfe lacked standing to bring the challenge under German law. The court asked the Court of Justice of the EU (ECJ) in a preliminary reference whether the environmental organization might have standing based directly on EU law, in particular the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters, read in conjunction with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The administrative court also ruled that the temperature window constitutes a defeat device but asked the ECJ whether the window can be justified under the exception in Regulation No 715/2007 that “the need for the device is justified in terms of protecting the engine against damage or accident and for safe operation of the vehicle.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On November 8, 2022, the ECJ answered that an administrative decision relating to EC type-approval, which may be contrary to EU law, falls within the material scope of Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, since it constitutes an act of a public authority that is alleged to contravene the national environmental provisions. An environmental association has standing under Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention if it meets the conditions under national law to bring legal proceedings. The ECJ also notes that member states must comply with the right to an effective remedy, enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter, when establishing the applicable procedural rules. Member states cannot impose criteria so strict that it would be impossible for environmental associations to challenge the acts or omissions that are the subject of the Aarhus Convention. The ECJ concluded that Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter, precludes a situation where such an association is unable to challenge a decision granting or amending EC type-approval which may be contrary to EU law. A defeat device can be justified by a need to protect the engine against damage or accident and for the safe operation of the vehicle. The ECJ held that such a justification only exists if the device strictly meets the need to avoid immediate risks of damage or accident to the engine of such a serious nature as to give rise to a specific hazard when a vehicle fitted with that device is driven. The need for such a defeat device exists only if no other technical solution makes it possible to avoid the above mentioned risks. The opposite conclusion could result in the exception being applied more frequently than the prohibition and would result in a disproportionate infringement of the principle of limiting nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions."

On the basis of the monitoring, the Government shall, if necessary, decide on the additional measures required to achieve the targets.“ The new Climate Change Act sets a target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 – a target recommended by Finland’s Climate Council. With the new law, there is now a legal obligation to reach carbon neutrality by 2035. However, the collapse of Finland’s carbon sinks in 2021 has created a situation where the government’s climate policy plans are insufficient for meeting the Climate Act’s targets. The reason is due to the intensive forest logging and the slowing down of forest growth that has become a source of greenhouse emissions.<br><br></div><div>The Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) and Greenpeace filed an appeal at the Supreme Administrative Court in Finland alleging a breach of the Finnish Climate Act, essentially claiming that the Finnish Government has neglected its duty to properly assess and decide on the need for additional measures pertaining to climate change mitigation when it decided to provide the Finnish Parliament with the Annual Climate Report. The environmental groups argued that the government had ignored its own laws by failing to protect the Nordic nation's carbon sinks which have fallen below the climate plans and to comply with the Climate Act, hence, the environmental groups demanded that the Finnish Government’s decision with respect to the Annual Climate Report 2022 be revoked and sent back to preparation.<br>The environmental organizations specifically refer to the obligations under the Paris Agreement, arguing that “Greenpeace and the Finnish Nature Conservation Union believe it is important to seek guidance from the court on whether the monitoring and updating of the progress of climate action works as it should according to the law and the parliament intention to act in the light of the statements.

The suit was filed in the Conseil d'Etat, the highest administrative court in France. According to an English summary of the case provided by the plaintiffs, the suit alleges that the French government's failure to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions violates domestic and international law, including the European Convention on Human Rights, the Paris Agreement, the French Environmental Code, and the French Environmental Charter. Plaintiffs stress that particular vulnerability of Grande-Synthe to the impacts of climate change as a low-lying coastal municipality exposed to sea level rise and flooding. According to the plaintiffs' case summary, Grande-Synthe asks the Conseil d'Etat to direct the government to take legislative and regulatory measures to prioritize action on climate change and to prohibit actions that would increase greenhouse gas emissions. This case is one of two filed in France during early 2019 against the French government for climate inaction and that follows logic set by the 2018 Urgenda decision in the Netherlands.

The Court also accepted interventions by NGOs and other interested cities. The Court then noted that France committed itself to a 40% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and instructed the government to justify its ability to meet this goal without stricter measures. Although the Court signaled the decision would be driven by French and European law and not the Paris Agreement, the Court reasoned that the Paris Agreement must be considered in the interpretation of national law.<br><br>The Council d'Etat issued a decision on July 1, 2021 ordering the government to ""take all the measures necessary"" by the end of March 2022 to bend the curve of greenhouse gas emissions to meet climate goals, including a 40% reduction by 2030. The Court annulled the government's implicit refusal to take necessary measures, noting that the emissions decreases in 2019 and 2020 were not enough to ensure compliance with the required climate goals, and current climate regulations were insufficient to meet the target. The Council ordered the government to take the necessary measures by March 31, 2022."

The prosecutor sought to impose a fine of 500 euros on each defendant. The court heard testimony from a former government minister that France has not complied with the Paris Agreement due to a lack of political will, and that only the president can order the action required by the present situation. An ecologist also testified about the necessity for rapid change in order to limit temperature rise.

The plaintiffs allege that Total failed to adequately assess the project's threats to human rights and the environment.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Under 2017 French Duty of Vigilance Law, French companies must identify and prevent, in a due diligence plan (plan de vigilance), serious violations of human rights and to the environment that could occur as a result of their business practices, including at the level of their foreign subsidiaries and subcontractors. In June 2019, Friends of the Earth France, Survie, AFIEGO, CRED, NAPE/Friends of the Earth Uganda and NAVODA sent Total a formal demand to revise its vigilance plan for the Tilenga Project, along with a report detailing alleged inadequacies in the vigilance plan. These associations claimed that Total did not take into account the social and environmental impacts of the oil project located on the shores of Lake Albert, in western Uganda, and the 1,445 km pipeline that will export fossil fuel by crossing part of the country and then Tanzania to reach the port of Tanga, on the Indian Ocean. Some 100,000 people are to be displaced and a third of the 400 boreholes are to be drilled in the Murchinson Falls National Park, which is home to a significant number of endangered species. The claimants sought an order to take urgent action to prevent the manifestly unlawful disturbance resulting the company’s failure to comply with its due diligence obligations. In the alternative, the claimants sought an order, subject to fine, to establish, publish and implement a set of measures in its due diligence plan to prevent (i) serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, human health and safety and (ii) serious environmental damage. Although the claimants' report focuses on human rights and conventional pollution, it also argues that Total's vigilance plan does not properly account for the project's potential life cycle greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Total rejected the allegations and argued that the court in which the case was filed was not competent. On January 30, 2020, the Nanterre Judicial Court ruled that it was not competent to hear the case and that it must be brought before a commercial court. On December 10th, 2020, the Court of Appeal of Versailles decided that the case should be brought before the Nanterre Commercial Court because the due diligence plan should be qualified as an “act of management of a commercial company.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On December 15th, 2021, the Court of Cassation overturned the judgment of the Versailles Court of Appeal and recognized the competence of the judicial court to judge the complaint of the associations. The case will be decided by the Nanterre Judicial Court, and not by the Commercial Court as Total had claimed. The Court of Cassation recalled that (i) companies’ duty of vigilance does not constitute a commercial act and (ii) a natural person plaintiff can bring a claim against a legal entity before the judicial court or the commercial court. While this decision is favorable for the claimant, more than 100 000 people are still totally or partially deprived of their land and their means of subsistence in Uganda and Tanzania, according to Friends of the Earth France.<br><br>"

The wind farm was expected to damage part of the forest cover and several protected species. The developer sought an exemption from the prohibition against harming natural habitats and protected animal and plant species under the French Environmental Code. Such an exemption may be granted “in the interest of public health and safety or for other imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including of a social or economic nature."" However, case law consistently holds that, even where such a public interest exists, a waiver can only be granted if there is no satisfactory alternative solution and it does not prejudice the maintenance of the affected species.<br><br></div><div>The prefect of Morbihan granted the waiver. Two local associations -- Society for the Protection of Landscapes and Aesthetics of France and Society for the Study and Protection of Nature in Brittany -- along with several local residents brought an action for annulment of this decree. The lower court granted their requests and annulled the order; the ACA then overturned the judgment after the developer appealed.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The ACA reasoned that the wind farm increases the production of renewable energy, making it easier to meet the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change provided by legislation, by regional planning instruments, by European-level position papers, and by international agreements. The ACA also noted the region’s high energy dependency. Thus, taking into account this local context and the need to meet the objectives of developing renewable energy, the court ruled that the project must be considered as meeting an imperative reason of major public interest likely to justify the harm to protected species. The court also analyzed the measures to avoid, reduce, compensate for and monitor the project's impacts on the protected areas, and concluded that their implementation would allow the maintenance of the species concerned in a favorable conservation status.<br><br>"

This type of letter is part of a legal proceeding known as “recours en carence fautive” (action for failure to act). The plaintiffs allege that the French government’s failure to implement proper measures to effectively address climate change violated a statutory duty to act. The four plaintiff groups are Fondation pour la Nature et l’Homme (FNH), Greenpeace France, Notre Affaire à Tous and Oxfam France. In their press release, they describe the lawsuit as challenging the state's inaction on climate change and failure to meet its own goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing renewable energy, and limiting energy consumption.<br><br></div><div>On February 15, 2019, the French government rejected the plaintiffs' request. On March 14, 2019, the plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit by filing a ""summary request"" before the Administrative Court of Paris. The plaintiffs request that the State of France be enjoined to remedy its inadequate action on climate change. Specifically, they request the court to order France to:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>1. Take proper measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere - in due proportion considering global emissions, and taking into account the particular responsibility accepted by developed countries - at a level compatible with the objective to contain the rise of the average temperature of the planet below the threshold of 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial levels;<br>2. Take, at least, all necessary measures to achieve France's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, developing renewable energies and increasing energy efficiency;<br>3. Take the necessary measures to adapt the national territory to the effects of climate change;<br>4. Take the necessary measures to protect citizens’ lives and health from the risks of climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>They further request compensation for the damages suffered as a result of the State’s failure to tackle climate change to be paid as “the symbolic sum of 1 euro for their moral prejudice.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>According to a translation of the legal request, plaintiffs argue that the government has both general and specific legal duties to act on climate change. Its general duties stem from 1) the French Charter for the Environment (“the Charter”), the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECPHR), and 3) the general principle of law providing the right of every person to live in a preserved climate system. Under the Charter, plaintiffs point to citizens’ constitutional rights to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment and argue the government has a duty of care to “take all necessary measures to identify, avoid, reduce and compensate the consequences of climate change.” Like other recent international cases, they point to further obligations of the state to act on climate change to uphold the rights guaranteed under Articles 2 &amp; 8 of the ECPHR, respectively “the right to life” and the “right to respect for private and family life.” They argue that these rights require States “to implement a legislative and regulatory framework and to adopt practical measures meant to fight efficiently against climate change.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Plaintiffs further base their claims on a “general principle of law” providing a right to a “preserved climate system” which they argue stems from national law (such as the preamble of the Charter for the Environment, article L. 110-1 of the French Environment Code, etc.) and international law (the Stockholm Declaration, the World Charter for Nature, the Rio Declaration, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto protocol, the Paris Agreement, the Climate action and renewable energy package for 2020, the Decision n°406/2009/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 23 April 2009). Plaintiffs additionally argue the State has further “specific” obligations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions under EU and national law as well as specific obligations to take action to prepare for the impacts of climate change on France.<br><br>On June 26th, 2020, the ministry for the ecological transition asked the administrative court's judge to dismiss the request. According to the plaintiffs, the government asserted that it was taking action to address greenhouse gas emissions, and that the time has not elapsed for it to meet its 2020 goals.<br><br>The case was heard in court on January 14, 2020. At the hearing the public rapporteur (independant consultant judge who provides an opinion to help guide the court's decision) issued an opinion. According to the plaintiffs, the opinion urged the court to recognize the fault of the French government, to recognize climate change as pure ecological damage, to award damages of one euro for moral prejudice, but to stop short of issuing an injunction because past damage cannot be repaired.<br><br></div><div>On February 3, 2021, the Administrative Court of Paris issued a decision recognising that France's inaction has caused ecological damage from climate change and awarded the plaintiffs the requested one euro for moral prejudice caused by this inaction. The Court deferred the decision the on whether to issue an injunction to order the French government to take stronger climate measures, and ordered the government to disclose steps it was taking to meet its climate targets within two months. As part of the decision, the Court held that France could be held responsible for failing to meet its own climate and carbon budget goals under EU and national law. But the Court rejected arguments that the government could be forced to meet more specific renewable energy and energy efficiency targets on the grounds that such sectoral measures cannot be independently directly linked to ecological damage. Further, the Court declined to issue compensatory damages for ecological harm, as the Court found that the plaintiffs had not shown that the government will be unable to repair the harm caused.<br><br>On October 14, 2021, the administrative court of Paris ordered the State to take immediate and concrete actions to comply with its commitments on cutting carbon emissions and repair the damages caused by its inaction by December 31, 2022. The court determined that France emitted 62 million extra tonnes of emissions from 2015-2018, though it lowered the amount to 15 million tonnes, taking into account the drop in emissions in 2020. The court thus called on France to subtract the emissions caused in excess of its legislative commitments, adding these to the reduction of emissions planned between 2021 and 2022. France has committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 40 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Any future slippage of emissions beyond the legislative commitments must also be compensated. The court rejected a request to have France to pay 78 million euros per semester of delay in meeting the emissions goals, and said it is up to the Prime minister and the government to come up with the measures to fix the problem."

The complainants claim there is a conflict of interest (prise illégale d’intérêt) by Mr. Pouyanné in establishing a Total research and development center dedicated to renewable energy in the campus of the École Polytechnique, a French public institution of higher education and research.

At that time, the content of the partnership between the public institution and the oil company was still being defined. On June 25, 2020, the Board of Directors gave its final approval for the Total Research Center. According to the complaint, between September 2018 and June 2020, Mr. Pouyanné held a public service mission as a board member.

It also held that adherence to the trajectory, which provides for a 12% drop in emissions for the period 2024-2028, did not appear to be achievable unless new measures were not quickly adopted.

Luciano Lliuya’s suit alleged that RWE, having knowingly contributed to climate change by emitting substantial volumes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), bore some measure of responsibility for the melting of mountain glaciers near his town of Huaraz, population 120,000. That melting has given rise to an acute threat: Palcacocha, a glacial lake located above Huaraz, has experienced a substantial volumetric increase since 1975, which has accelerated since 2003. Luciano Lliuya presented several legal theories in support of his claim, including one that characterized RWE's emissions as a nuisance that Luciano Lliuya had incurred compensable costs to mitigate. Acknowledging that RWE was only a contributor to the emissions responsible for climate change and thus for the lake's growth, Luciano Lliuya asked the court to order RWE to reimburse him for a portion of the costs that he and the Huaraz authorities are expected to incur to establish flood protections. That portion was 0.47% of the total cost -- the same percentage as RWE’s estimated contribution to global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of industrialisation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The court dismissed Luciano Lliuya’s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as his request for damages. The court noted that it could not provide Luciano Lliuya with effective redress (Luciano Lliuya's situation would not change, the court said, even if RWE ceased emitting), and that no “linear causal chain” could be discerned amid the complex components of the causal relationship between particular greenhouse gas emissions and particular climate change impacts.<br><br></div><div>On November 30, 2017, the appeals court recognized the complaint as well-pled and admissible. The case will move forward into the evidentiary phase to determine whether the Luciano Lliuya’s home is (a) threatened by flooding or mudslide as a result of the recent increase in the volume of the glacial lake located nearby, and (b) how RWE’s greenhouse gas emissions contribute to that risk. The court will review expert opinion on the RWE’s CO2 emissions, the contribution of those emissions to climate change, the resulting impact on the Palcaraju Glacier, and RWE’s contributory share of responsibility for causing the preceding effects. While the facts of this case must still be adjudicated, the court’s recognition that a private company could potentially be held liable for the climate change related damages of its greenhouse gas emissions marks a significant development in law."

They further alleged that failure to meet the original 2020 goal violates Germany’s minimum obligations under the EU Effort Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>According to Greenpeace, plaintiffs asked for court orders holding that the government is obliged to: 1) implement the national Climate Protection Program 2020 by updating or supplementing appropriate measures to meet the 2020 target; 2) compensate for the excess of approximately 650 million tons of CO2 equivalent between 2007 and today due to insufficient implementation of the 2020 target; and 3) supplement the national Climate Protection Program 2020 to meet the reduction targets set out in European environmental law.

The court further held that plaintiffs had not conclusively demonstrated that the government had violated its constitutional obligations by setting inadequate climate protection targets. However, the court did hold that the government’s climate policy is subject to judicial review and must be consistent with the government’s duties to protect fundamental rights under the German Constitution. The court also determined that the government must undertake measures to provide adequate and effective protection of the fundamental rights potentially affected by climate change, including the rights to life and property. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the government is entitled to wide discretion in deciding how to fulfill these obligations, so long as precautionary measures to protect fundamental rights are not wholly unsuitable or wholly inadequate. In the court’s view, the government’s current protection policy, which will lower emissions by 32% rather than 40% by the end of 2020, is within its discretion.<br><br></div><div>Moreover, the court noted that the EU is only aiming for a 40% reduction in greenhouse emissions by 2030 and has pledged a reduction of only 20% below 1990 levels by 2020. In this context, the court concluded that the German government’s reduction target of 32% by the end of 2020 does not appear to be completely inadequate.<br><br>"

By decision of 17 February 2014, the German authorities made a decision to allocate Evonik Degussa allowances for the years 2013-2020, which decision made clear that the activity of extracting hydrogen from rich gas was not taken into account for the purposes of the allocation. By decision of 25 August 2015, the German authorities confirmed their original decision on the ground, inter alia, that the hydrogen was already present in the rich gas source streams, and it was not the result of a production by Evonik Degussa. Evonik Degussa appealed this decision before the Administrative Court in Berlin. The dispute in the main proceedings concerns whether the production of hydrogen by purification of rich gases ought to have been taken into account for the allocation of allowances.

The complainants argued that in order to ""do its part"" to achieve the Paris Agreement targets, Germany would need to reduce GHGs by 70% from 1990 levels by 2030. Their claims principally arose out of the principle of human dignity allegedly enshrined in Article 1 of the Basic Law; Article 2 of the Basic Law, which protects the right to life and physical integrity; and Article 20a of the Basic Law, which protects the natural foundations of life in responsibility for future generations. Complainants argued that by requiring insufficient short and medium term GHG reductions and allowing for the transfer of emission allocations between Germany and other EU Member States despite the inadequacy of the overall EU emissions reduction target, the KSG allowed climate impacts that violate these human rights.<br><br></div><div>The complaint asked the Federal Constitutional Court to declare that the legislature violated the Basic Law by requiring only a 55% reduction in GHGs by 2030; declare that the legislature is required to issue new reduction quotas to ensure that Germany's emissions are kept as low as possible, taking into account the principle of proportionality; and prohibit the transfer of emissions allocations in the new regulatory regime.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On April 29, 2021, the Federal Constitutional Court struck down the parts of the KSG as incompatible with fundamental rights for failing to set sufficient provisions for emissions cuts beyond 2030. The Court found that Article 20a of the Basic Law obliges the legislature to protect the climate and aim towards achieving climate neutrality. Further, the Court stated that Article 20a ""is a justiciable legal norm that is intended to bind the political process in favour of ecological concerns, also with a view to the future generations that are particularly affected."" Accepting arguments that the legislature must follow a carbon budget approach to limit warming to well below 2°C and, if possible, to 1.5°C, the Court found that that legislature had not proportionally distributed the budget between current and future generations. The Court held that “the regulations at stake would be unconstitutional if they allowed so much of the remaining budget to be consumed that the future loss of freedom would inevitably assume unacceptable proportions from today's perspective, because there would be no time left for mitigating developments and transformations.” The Court ordered the legislature to set clear provisions for reduction targets from 2031 onward by the end of 2022.

The plaintiffs relied on the German Constitution (Basic Law) to call on the state legislature to set a GHG emissions reduction pathway, to comply with the remaining CO2 budget and adopt sufficient instruments to achieve and verify the climate protection targets set by the Paris Agreement.<br><br></div><div>According to plaintiffs, the state’s 2020 Climate Protection Act (NKlimaG) goals for the years 2030 (emissions reductions of 55%) and 2050 (climate neutrality), failed to set intermittent goals and a legal structure for monitoring and enforcement. Furthermore, plaintiffs argued that the NKlimaG’s climate neutrality goal for 2050 violated federal law, where climate neutrality was stipulated for 2045.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The plaintiffs relied on the Constitutional Court’s decision in (Neubauer v. Germany), following which Germany adjusted its climate goals at the federal level. Plaintiffs argued that codification of a constitutional and legally binding reduction path is also required at the state level, as states bear co-responsibility for protecting lives and civil liberties, including safeguarding the natural foundations of life for future generations, within their own sphere of competence. Plaintiffs argued that the Lower Saxony law falls short of these constitutional requirements. Plaintiffs asserted a violation by the state of its duty to protect and invoked their constitutional rights, to defend themselves against considerable future restrictions on their freedoms which – in view of rapidly progressing climate change – are to be considered inevitable and are already reflected in the insufficient action by the legislature of Lower Saxony.<br><br></div><div>On January 18, 2022, the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court did not admit the eleven complaints for adjudication, on the basis of a lack of adequate prospects. Widely in alignment with its decision in (Neubauer v. Germany), the Court acknowledged that greenhouse gas reduction burdens cannot be unilaterally offloaded onto the future. However, in the cases at hand, complainants’ fundamental rights were not violated preemptively, because the state legislatures are not subject to a CO2 emissions budget, which (according to the Court in Neubauer v. Germany) is a prerequisite for such an effect. Rather it is the federal German legislature that is bound by the CO2 budget, but has a prerogative with respect to its implementation. As regards the federal states, the Court clarified that they too are responsible for climate protection, in particular by virtue of Article 20a of the Basic Law.<br><br>"

For the first time in its jurisprudence, the Court stated that “the fundamental rights - as intertemporal guarantees of freedom - afford protection against the greenhouse gas reduction burdens imposed by Art. 20a of the Basic Law being unilaterally offloaded onto the future."" Consequently, the Constitutional Court ordered the federal German legislature to set clear provisions for reduction targets. In response to the decision, the federal lawmakers passed a bill approving an adapted KSG, which has been in effect since August 31, 2021. It raised the reduction target for 2030 from 55% to 65% (as compared to 1990 levels). It also updated the reduction path for the years 2031-2040, and elaborated on the legislative involvement in the determination of the individual sector budgets from 2031 onwards. Lastly, the target year for achieving carbon neutrality was brought forward from 2050 to 2045.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Relying on a new factual basis and scientific updates, claimants argue that the amended KSG and its reduction targets are insufficient to protect their fundamental rights:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In August 2021, the IPCCC released the first part of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6WGI), on the scientific basis of climate change. The report details how the 1.5°C limit may be surpassed in roughly 10 years. In the Report, the IPCC also refined previous calculations on residual budgets, directly transferrable onto Germany’s remaining budget. Beyond these developments in international climate science, claimants also invoked the Glasgow Climate Pact. In this joint final declaration of COP26, the UNFCCC’s contracting parties agreed to significantly strengthen the 1.5°C target, which includes drastic emissions reductions before the end of the decade.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Claimants argue that the new reduction path continues to infringe on their fundamental rights, as it will use up large parts of Germany’s remaining CO2 budget, as determined in accordance with Article 20a of the Basic Law. Rather, claimants argue, both reduction paths, i.e., from 2021-2030, and after 2030 exceed the budget limits and put Germany way above the Paris and/or Glasgow targets. In addition, claimants argue that the risk of considerable impairments of their fundamental rights is further increased by the lack of clear obligations on, and coordinated efforts across the federal states. As a result, the federal states have very differing and at times insufficient climate protection policies. Claimants ask the Constitutional Court to declare parts of the amended KSG unconstitutional and to order the federal legislature to re-regulate the reduction pathway in light of new scientific constraints, and to make provision for the distribution of the reduction burden across the federal states.&nbsp;<br><br><br>"

Furthermore, it did not find the missing information on the packaging as to how climate neutrality was achieved as misleading by omission pursuant to § 5a of the Act against Unfair Competition, because it held that the means of achieving climate-neutrality was not essential information.<br><br></div><div>More specifically, the Higher Regional Court held that the claim ‘climate neutral ‘did not suggest that the company exclusively produced climate neutral products. Furthermore, it stated that ‘climate neutrality’ was an unambiguous statement and that it meant that the products advertised with it had a balanced carbon footprint. Lastly, it held that the claim ‘climate neutral’ did not mean that the balanced balance was achieved completely by avoiding emissions during the production. This applied all the more if the claim was combined with a clearly visible indication that climate protection projects were supported in order to achieve climate neutrality. It stated that explanatory notes on the type and scope of the compensation measures were not required. Thus, it did not find that the advertising claim ‘climate neutral’ for a product was misleading per se. This was all the truer if at the same time it was pointed out that climate neutrality was achieved through compensation measures.&nbsp;"

This fund invested in renewable energies projects and could therefore track concrete amounts of green electricity and avoided CO2 emissions. Furthermore, klimaVest was an Impact Fonds according to European Regulations and was obliged to pursue a positive ecological goal. This resulted in the ‘klimaVest target (set value)’ of at least 3.5 tonnes of CO2 avoidance per EUR 10,100 invested per year. Thus, investors were able to indirectly support the avoidance of future emissions with their investment. On the website, internet users could calculate their personal CO2 footprint. This value was then compared with the desired ‘CO2 offset’ through the investment. In a separate document, information was included that the investment objectives of the fund could not be guaranteed and that they could vary considerably over time. Under the FAQ category it was set out that the impact goal of klimaVest was to achieve a CO2 offset of at least 3.0 tonnes per year for every 10,000 euros of invested capital. The calculation basis for that was the CO2 calculator.<br><br></div><div>The plaintiff filed a claim with the Regional Court of Stuttgart and argued that the advertising statements were misleading after the defendant themselves had massively relativised in other places. The defendant responded that the value was an investment ‘target’ and could therefore be exceeded as well as fallen short of. With regard to the various quantities, an amount that was too low had been stated by mistake. An imputed misleading was therefore not relevant in any case.<br><br></div><div>The Regional Court found the advertised claims to be misleading commercial practices and in violation of § 5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition. It held that the claim of an absolute CO2 reduction of 3.5t or of a CO2 compensation of -3.5t was a statement suitable to mislead the target public, since they understood these statements as set values, which in any case would not be fallen short of, although these were in fact target values which could be significantly undercut. Furthermore, the Court found the differing statements on the targeted CO2 avoidance of 3.5t on one site and 3.5t on another site to be misleading by omission pursuant to §5a para. 2 of the Act against Unfair Competition."

According to the applicant, the unregulated building and construction activities would cause irreversible damage to the environment, thereby having serious repercussions on climate change. This exemption is also in derogation of India’s international commitments to the Rio Declaration 1992 and Paris Agreement 2015, especially when read in the light of the precautionary principle. The respondent, Ministry of Environment and Forests, contended that the draft notification is a policy decision taken by the Government of India to provide affordable housing to the weaker section of the society under the ‘Housing for All by 2022’ scheme. The NGT, exercising its jurisdiction, upheld the applicant’s contention. The 2016 draft notification considerably dilutes the regime of environmental clearance in building and construction activities, thereby, leading to severe environmental impacts. The principle of non-regression, an accepted norm in international environmental law, mandates that environmental law should not be modified to the detriment of environmental protection.<br><br></div><div>Accordingly, the NGT declared illegal those parts of a government draft notification that exempted specific building and construction projects from the environmental clearance requirement. Domestically, the construction sector emits 22% of India’s total annual carbon-dioxide emission and has a significant energy footprint. In the name of ‘ease of doing responsible business’, the government ignored environmental impacts that have a direct bearing on environmental protection, climate change and sustainable development. Environmental clearances, as a part of the precautionary approach, require the drafting of an EIA report.<br><br></div><div>The EIA report evaluates carbon emissions associated with the construction project, its adverse impact on the environment, and best practice strategies to reduce these emissions.

The case relates to large scale and uncontrolled forest fires ravaging the States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh thereby undermining the ecological sustainability of an already endangered biological zone. Emissions released by forest fires include carbon dioxide CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4), organic aerosols and black carbon, non-methane organic compounds, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and Sulphur dioxide (SO2). These emissions affect the efficiency of both atmospheric and surface absorption of solar energy, with resultant cooling and or warming effects. Forest fires have a devastating effect on the glaciers of Uttarakhand, which are the life line of major north Indian rivers, have been covered by ‘black carbon’ causing them to melt faster. The respondents, States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, contended that the year 2016 saw extremely low rainfall thereby causing a serious moisture deficit in the soil and in the forest areas, thereby making conditions conducive to the occurrence and spread of forest fires.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The NGT saw merit in the respondents’ argument but required a better advance planning and implementation of the Fire Management Plan and Crisis Management plan for forest fires.

The Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (Renewable Energy Obligation) Regulations, 2007 and Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (Renewable Energy Certificate and Renewable Purchase Obligation Compliance Framework) Regulations 2010 imposed Renewable Energy obligation (RE obligation) on the captive generation entities to purchase minimum energy from renewable sources and to pay a surcharge in case of shortfall in meeting the RE obligation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Aggrieved by the judgment, in 2013 the captive generation companies filed an appeal before the Supreme Court. The companies contended that they have established their own captive generation power plants in terms of the Electricity Act, 2003. The purpose of the Electricity Act 2003 is to encourage participation of private sectors involved in generation of electricity and with that objective, generation of electricity was de-licensed and captive generation was freely promoted. It liberalized the establishment of captive power plants and exempted them from any licensing and regulatory regime.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Further, the National Electricity Policy, 2005 and the Tariff Policy, 2006 were framed to promote production and utilization of energy to the maximum extent in respect of the captive generation plants. It was not intended to compulsorily force these companies to lower their production of energy by making them purchase renewable energy. Consequently, the 2007 and 2010 Regulations violative the basic object and purpose of the Electricity Act 2003.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The moot issue in this case relates to whether the aggrieved captive power plant companies are covered by the 2007 and 2010 regulations that mandate green power purchase. On 13 May 2015, the Supreme Court of India upheld the validity of the 2007 and 2010 Regulations with respect to the renewable energy purchase obligation. The court approved the promotion and co-generation of electricity from renewable source of energy by employing constitutional mandates that focus on larger public interest and clean environment. The State and its instrumentalities are under a duty to protect the environment in order to ensure that the citizens/residents of the area lead a healthy life. This is the laudable object of the State and to achieve the same it has framed the respective electricity policies and regulations. Accordingly the Supreme Court observed “the National Action Plan on Climate Change and Preamble of the Act of 2003 emphasises promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies to encourage generation and consumption of green energy to sub-serve the mandate of Article 21 read with Article 48A of the Directive Principles of the State Policy and Article 51A(g) of the Fundamental Duties enlisted under Chapter IVA of the Constitution of India.

The emission of this by-product has 14,800 times more global warming potential (being a greenhouse gas) compared to carbon dioxide thereby leading to ozone depletion. The excessive release of greenhouse gas may set off a climate bomb and severely affect the environment. The petitioner relied on constitutional mandates, namely Articles 48A (duty of the state to protect the environment), 51A(g) (fundamental duty of the citizen to protect and improve the environment), and section 3 of the Environment Protection Act 1986 that give powers to Central Government to take such measures as deemed necessary or expedient for the purpose of protecting and improving quality of the environment and preventing, controlling and abating environmental pollution. However, the respondent, namely, the Ministry of Environment and Forests raised a preliminary objection by stating that the petition is unmaintainable as it falls outside the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal. The bye-product HFC-23 does not fall within the Acts specified in Schedule-I of the NGT Act and therefore the tribunal could not entertain the petition.<br><br></div><div>On 10th December 2015, the NGT held it has the jurisdiction to hear the case as the greenhouse gas has been a matter of concern at the national and international level as part of the environment. The NGT Act 2010 is social welfare legislation and intended to provide expeditious justice in civil environmental cases. However, the tribunal found that the regulation of HFC-23 relates to a matter of global policy which must be regulated under international law. As such the court understood that “there would be a very little role for the statutory authorities within the country to take appropriate measures.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The tribunal acknowledged that undisputedly HFC-23 has an effect on global warming being part of greenhouse gases, and at present there is a gap in scientific understanding of HFC-23’s toxic impact on the air and its categorization as a pollutant. The tribunal further observed “the international conventions and treaties have to provide a path for domestic legislation and in any case it has failed and be regulated without further delay.” Accordingly, the NGT directed the regulatory authorities and expert bodies to conduct a comprehensive data base study on HFC-23, being a pollutant and the extent of its impact on global warming, being part of greenhouse gases. On 27th September 2021, India ratified the Kigali Amendment of the Montreal Protocol, to reduce and phase out the use of hydrofluorocarbons by eighty percent by 2050.<br><br>No case documents are available for this case."

Case was filed, it has not yet been decided.","A petition filed by Earthjustice on behalf of the Arctic Athabaskan Council alleges that Canada's fragmentary and lax regulations of black carbon emissions threaten the Athabaskan people's human rights. The petition describes that the arctic is witnessing disproportionately large rates of warming, and alleges that this warming is having significant adverse impacts on the Athabaskan people. Those impacts include ecological disruptions that make hunting and fishing more difficult and dangerous, changes to regional topography of cultural significance, and the compromising of the Athabaskans' ability to make sense of their environment for purposes ranging from subsistence to maintenance of cultural traditions. The petition connects these impacts and the warming that causes them to black carbon by explaining that it is a pollutant with severe climate-forcing effects, including the substantial reduction in albedo (reflectivity) of snow and ice. According to the petition, Canada's failure to regulate black carbon emissions effectively is the beginning of a causal chain that ends in the violation of the Athabaskans' rights to enjoy the benefits of their culture, to property, to the preservation of health, and to their own means of subsistence as established by the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. That failure also, according to the petition, results in violations of Canada's duties to avoid transboundary harm and to protect the environment consistent with the precautionary principle. The petitioners, anticipating arguments that they failed to pursue remedies via administrative proceedings in Canada and its provinces, explain that such an approach was not feasible for the Athabaskans. For relief, the petitioners request: investigations via onsite visit and a hearing before the Commission; a declaration by the Commission that Canada's failure to regulate domestic black carbon emissions violates the American Declaration; and establishment and implementation of a plan to protect the Athabaskan people in coordination with the petitioners and the Athabaskans themselves."

The opinion further discussed the responsibility of governments for significant environmental damage that they cause within and beyond their borders. The Court's advisory opinion enables all States who recognize the jurisdiction of the Court—and the citizens of those countries—to file claims regarding environmental harms that impact their human rights. In such a case, the Court would assess whether the respondent State met three types of obligations: 1. Obligations to Prevent Environmental Damages: States must: A) issue regulations to prevent damages, B) establish contingency plans to minimize the possibility of major environmental accidents, C) mitigate significant damage that has already occurred, and D) carry out environmental impact studies under the conditions indicated by the Court. The Court requires environmental impact studies to address cumulative impacts, allow the participation of interested persons, and respect the traditions and culture of indigenous peoples. These studies must also be conducted by independent entities and occur prior to the activities that they evaluate. 2. Obligations to Cooperate: States must: A) cooperate in good faith with States and individuals potentially affected by environmental damage, B) notify potentially affected States that a planned activity under their jurisdiction could generate a risk of significant transboundary damages and of environmental emergencies, and C) negotiate in good faith with States potentially affected by significant transboundary harm. 3. Obligations to Provide Information, Justice, and Public Participation: States must: A) access to information related to possible effects on the environment, B) the opportunity for citizens to publicly participate in making decisions and policies that may affect the environment, and C) access to justice through national courts in regard to their environmental obligations. The Court clarified that persons potentially affected by transboundary damages must have access to justice without discrimination based on their nationality, residence, or the location of the environmental damage.

As part of this proceeding, Costa Rica sought compensation for the loss of environmental goods and services the country sustained due to Nicaragua's excavation of channels on its territory. Among the services for which Costa Rica sought compensation was the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide ""gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration."" On February 2, 2018, the ICJ ruled how much Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica for the loss of environmental services. This followed a ruling on the merits from December 16, 2015 that established that Nicaragua's activities were unlawful and violated Costa Rica's territorial sovereignty and navigational rights, as well as the Court's Order of 8 March 2011, and found that Costa Rica should be compensated for these unlawful activities.


Costa Rica argued that Nicaragua had, on two separate incidents, occupied the territory of Costa Rica in connection with the construction of a canal across Costa Rican territory from the San Juan River to Laguna los Portillos (or ""Harbor Head Lagoon"") and associated acts of dredging on the San Juan River. Nicaragua removed nearly 300 trees and cleared 6.19 hectares of vegetation in excavating the Costa Rican channels. The Costa Rican government sought compensation for the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide environmental goods and services including ""gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration."" In ruling for Costa Rica, the ICJ reasoned that Nicaragua's activities significantly undermined the ability of the two areas to provide environmental goods and services. Because this loss of environmental services was a direct result of Nicaragua's actions, the ICJ ruled that Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica US$120,000 for the impairment or loss of the environmental goods and services of the impacted area in the period prior to recovery. Furthermore, the ICJ did ""not consider that the impairment or loss"" of carbon sequestration services could be valued as a one- time loss. This was the first case wherein in ICJ adjudicated a claim for compensation for environmental damage."

The Committee must determine if the petition is actionable before making findings or recommendations.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Brazil, France and Germany responded to the petition, arguing that it was not admissible on three grounds: 1) the Committee lacks jurisdiction; 2) the petition is manifestly ill-founded or unsubstantiated; and 3) petitioners have not exhausted domestic remedies. On May 4, 2020, the petitioners filed a reply asserting that the petition is admissible. They argue: 1) that the Committee has jurisdiction because the children are ""directly and foreseeably injured by greenhouse gas emissions originating in Respondents' territory;"" 2) the claims are manifestly well-founded because the children are suffering direct and personal harms now and will continue to in the foreseeable future; and 3) that pursuing domestic remedies would be futile.<br><br>On October 12, 2021, the CRC rejected the claim as inadmissible. The Committee accepted the claimant's arguments that States are legally responsible for the harmful effects of emissions originating in their territory on children outside their borders. The fact that all states are causing climate change does not absolve states of individual responsibility to reduce their own share of emissions. The Committee also found that the youth are victims of foreseeable threats to their rights to life, health, and culture.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Following the reasoning of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR)’&nbsp; <a href=""http://climatecasechart.com/climate-change-litigation/non-us-case/request-advisory-opinion-inter-american-court-human-rights-concerning-interpretation-article-11-41-51-american-convention-human-rights/"">2017 advisory opinion</a>, the CRC found that countries have extraterritorial responsibilities related to carbon pollution. Using the IACtHR's test for jurisdiction, the Committee found that when transboundary harm occurs, children are under the jurisdiction of the State on whose territory the emissions originated if there is a causal link between the acts or omissions of the State in question and the negative impact on the rights of children located outside its territory, when the State of origin exercises effective control over the sources of the emissions in question.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>While the Committee said that the children had shown, for jurisdictional purposes, that the impairment of their rights as a result of the State party’s acts or omissions regarding the carbon emissions originating within its territory was reasonably foreseeable, it held that the complaint was inadmissible for a failure to exhaust local remedies."

The complaint calls on several Special Rapporteurs to intervene and investigate, and to recommend that the U.S. government and the states of Alaska and Louisiana take steps to address displacement caused by climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Alaska Institute for Justice submitted the complaint on behalf of five tribes located in Louisiana and Alaska: Point-au-Chien Indian Tribe, Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Citimacha-Cochtow Tribe, the Atakapa-Ishak Chawasha Tribe of the Grand Bayou Indian Village, and the Native Village of Kivalina. The complaint is directed to the Special Rapporteurs on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, among others. The complainants assert that they are being forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands as a result of climate change, and that the U.S. government has failed to protect them despite knowing for decades that climate change threatens coastal communities. They further contend that the U.S. government's inaction has gone beyond basic negligence where the government has failed to engage, consult, acknowledge and promote the self-determination of the tribes as they develop adaptation strategies, including resettlement. The complaint also alleges that by failing to federally recognize the named Louisiana tribes, the U.S. government is further hamstringing efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.<br><br></div><div>The complaint asks the Special Rapporteurs to recommend that the U.S. government recognize the self-determination and inherent sovereignty of all the tribes; grant federal recognition to those that have not yet received it; and take certain steps to protect the tribes' land and cultural heritage, among other things. The complaint further asks the Special Rapporteurs to recommend that the Louisiana state government allocate funding to the named Louisiana tribes to respond to the humanitarian crisis caused by climate change; require the oil and gas industry to give advanced notice of their intent to conduct operations that may pose a risk to tribal cultural heritage, land, and waters; and hold oil and gas corporations responsible for damages caused to the Louisiana coast, among other things. The complaint also seeks a recommendation that the Alaska state government allocate funding to implement the tribal-led relocation process for Kivalina, and that all three governments develop relocation institutional frameworks.<br><br></div><div>The complainants' claims arise out of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Pinheiro Principles on Housing and Property Restitution, and the Peninsula Principles on human rights that must be enforced when people are forcibly displaced because of climate change. The complaint also cites the right to self-determination of all peoples, the Charter of the UN, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and Article 3 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.<br><br>In September 2020, the Special Rapporteurs communicated the case the U.S. government, detailed the allegations, sought clarification on the measures taken by the government, and included a reference annex on international human rights law."

The Committee concluded that the communication was admissible, but that New Zealand's decision was not clearly arbitrary, a manifest error, or a denial of justice.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In 2013, Ioene Teitiota, a Kiribati citizen, sought asylum in New Zeleand, asserting that the effects of climate change and sea level rise forced him to migrate. When the Immigration and Protection Tribunal denied his claim, he appealed to the New Zealand High Court. The High Court found that the impacts of climate change on Kirabati did not qualify Teitiota for refugee status because he was not subjected to persecution required for the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Teitioa appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals. In dismissing the application, the Court of Appeals noted the gravity of climate change but stated that the Refugee Convention did not appropriately address the issue. Teitiota again appealed, this time before the Supreme Court of New Zealand. In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts’ conclusions, but did not rule out the possibility “that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could [] create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction.”<br><br></div><div>On September 15, 2015, Teitiota filed a communication with the UN Human Rights Committee, alleging that New Zealand had violated his right to life under the International Covenant on Social and Political Rights. He argued that sea level rise in Kiribati caused by climate change has created a scarcity of habitable space, resulting in violent land disputes, and environmental degradation including saltwater contamination of the freshwater supply. On January 7, 2020, the Committee ruled that the communication was admissible because Teitiota had sufficiently substantiated his claim that when he was removed to Kiribati he faced an imminent risk of being arbitrarily deprived of his life due to the effects of sea level rise. The Committee reasoned that the requirement of imminence attaches to the decision to remove the individual, and not to the anticipated harm in the receiving state, although the latter is relevant in assessing the real risk faced by the individual.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Committee dismissed the communication on the merits, however, explaining that it could only reverse a States party's determination that was clearly arbitrary or amounted to a manifest error or a denial of justice. The Committee reasoned that the risk of an arbitrary deprivation of life must be personal, rather than rooted in the general conditions of the receiving state, except in the most extreme cases. The Committee recognized that environmental degradation and climate change constitute serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life, but upheld New Zealand's determination that Teitiota had not provided evidence that he faced any real chance of being harmed in a land dispute, would be unable to grow food or access potable water, or otherwise faced life-threatening conditions.<br><br></div><div>The Committee did find, however, that ""given that the risk of an entire country becoming submerged under water is such an extreme risk, the conditions of life in such a country may become incompatible with the right to life with dignity before the risk is realized."" Accepting Teitiota's claim that sea level rise is likely to render Kiribati uninhabitable, the Committee explained that given the 10-15 year timeframe, there was sufficient time for intervening acts by the government of Kiribati to protect its citizens.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Two Committee members dissented. One attacked the majority's reliance on the lack of evidence that Teitiota's family lacked potable water, explaining that ""potable"" does not equate to ""safe drinking water."" The second argued that the Committee placed an unreasonable burden of proof on Teitiota to establish a real risk of danger of arbitrary deprivation of life."

RED II introduces measures to phase out biofuels which pose high risk significant GHG emissions from indirect land-use change (ILUC), which is defined as occurring where there is “cultivation of crops for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels displaces traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes.”<br>The European Commission’s Delegated Regulation 2019/807 (Delegated Regulation) introduced pursuant to RED II laid down the criteria for determining high-ILUC feedstock and certifying low ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. Based on the criteria set by the EU biofuel measures in determining high ILUC-risk fuels, only palm-oil-based biofuels, which are usually imported, will be phased out by 2030 (unless certified as low ILUC-risk). By contrast, biofuels based on oil crops, which are more likely to be produced domestically in EU, such as sunflower or rapeseed, are not subject to the phase out.<br><br></div><div>Following the introduction of RED II and the Delegated Resolution, France introduced a new law on fuel tax. The new fuel tax regime provides incentives for the consumption of petrol and diesel that contain certain crop-based biofuels to meet EU renewable energy targets. It provides expressly under the French Customs Code that palm-oil products are not considered as biofuels. Lithuania also amended its law on renewable energy, providing that by 2030, the share of fuels produced from feedstocks considered as high ILUC-risk feedstocks are to gradually decrease to nil for the calculation of Lithuania's gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On January 15, 2021, Malaysia brought a claim against the EU, France and Lithuania at the WTO. Malaysia claimed that certain measures imposed by virtue of RED II, including the criteria for determining the high ILUC-risk feedstock, and the sustainability and GHG emission savings criteria are discriminatory against palm-oil-based biofuels and are therefore inconsistent with various provisions under the TBT Agreement and GATT 1994.

Under this statute, electricity produced from renewable energy was awarded a guaranteed price per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity delivered into the Ontario electricity system under 20-year or 40-year contracts. Such scheme also included a mandatory percentage of local content requirements (LCRs), ranging from 25% to 60%. This entails that a certain amount of components had to be sourced from local enterprises.<br><br></div><div>Following the adoption of this legislation, on September 13, 2010, Japan filed a request for consultations before the World Trade Organisation (WTO) Dispute Resolution Body, claiming that the measures implemented by the State of Ontario to promote electricity from renewable energy sources were inconsistent with Canada’s obligation under:<br>(a) Articles III:4 and III:5 of the GATT 1994, as they were laws, regulations or requirements affecting the internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution, or use of equipment for renewable energy generation facilities that accord less favorable treatment to imported equipment than that accorded to like products originating in Ontario;<br>(b) Article 2.1 of the TRIMs Agreement, as they appeared to be trade-related investment measures that are inconsistent with the provisions of Article III of the GATT 1994; and<br>(c) Articles 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement, as they appeared to be a subsidy granted under the measures listed above within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement, because there would be a financial contribution or a form of income or price support, and a benefit would thereby be conferred.<br><br></div><div>The Canadian government defended the measures at stake, arguing that they were covered by the government procurement exception under Article III:8(a) GATT, as ‘the laws and requirements that create and implement the FIT Program are laws and requirements that govern the procurement of renewable electricity for the governmental purpose of securing electricity supply for Ontario consumers from clean sources, and not with a view to commercial resale’.<br><br></div><div>On December 19, 2012, the Panel issued its report on the case, upholding Japan's claims under Article 2.1 of the TRIMs Agreement and Article III:4 of the GATT 1994. In particular, the Panel found that the incentives scheme represented ‘investment measures’ covered by Article 1 TRIMs Agreement, and they were ‘trade-related’ in the sense that the ‘Minimum Required Domestic Content Level’ included in Ontario’s scheme ‘by definition favors the use of domestic products over imported products, and therefore affects trade’. On these grounds, the Panel ruled that the FIT program, to the extent that it features a LCR that is inconsistent with Article III:4 GATT, also integrates a TRIM inconsistent with Article 2.1 TRIMs Agreement. Moreover, the Panel rejected Canada’s exception under Article III:8(a) GATT, according to which the discriminatory measures were justified as government procurement. Instead, the Panel found that renewably generated electricity was indeed subsidized by Ontario ‘with a view to commercial resale’, as it was commercialized through the exact ‘same channels’ as all other generating sources, so that it was ‘in competition with private-sector electricity retailers’. Nevertheless, the Panel rejected the complaint that had been raised under the SCM Agreement, finding that it was not possible to establish that the incentives provided by the State of Ontario constitute a ‘benefit’ within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) SCM Agreement. In the Panel’s reasoning, this is due to the fact that, in practice, renewable electricity would not be able to compete against electricity from conventional sources without the governmental incentives. Therefore, the Panel concluded that due to the lack of a comparable market standard, the program could not be legally characterized as a subsidy.<br><br></div><div>On May 6, 2013, the Appellate Body issued its report on the case, which provided a partially different reasoning on some of the issues, while not determining substantial changes in the outcome of the case. In particular, the Appellate Body’s analysis focused on the applicability of the government procurement exception under Article III:8(a) GATT and on the existence of a prohibited or actionable subsidy under the SCM Agreement. With regard to the former issue, the Appellate Body provided a different interpretation than the Panel, to the extent that it recognized that the product subject to the local content requirements was renewable energy generation equipment, yet the product purchased by the Government of Ontario under the FIT Program is electricity. On this basis, the Appellate Body found that the lack of a direct competitive relationship between the two products ‘electricity’ and ‘generation equipment’ was determinant to exclude the applicability of the exception under Article III:8(a) GATT. With regard to the existence of a subsidy covered by the SCM Agreement, the Appellate Body argued that the benefit analysis should have been conducted by comparing Ontario’s FIT scheme with previous renewable energy support policies adopted by the Ontario’s government, rather than comparing it with conventional energy sources. However, it concluded that, given the lack of factual findings in the Panel’s report, and due to the procedural restraints under Article 17.6 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), it could not complete the analysis and determine ‘whether the challenged measures confer a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement and whether they constitute a prohibited subsidy inconsistent with Articles 3.1(b) and Article 3.2 of the SCM Agreement’.<br><br>"

Amongst other complaints, it was noted that whilst air pollution is already a significant concern in BiH, especially in areas where coal fired plants are operating, new units and plants are still being planned and constructed. This will “negatively affect the air quality and public health for decades,” through emissions of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2, over hundreds of kilometers. Some adverse health impacts associated with one of the power stations (Tuzla) include thousands of cases of (chronic) bronchitis and asthma in children and adults, and over 150 hospitalizations for respiratory issues and cardiac arrest. It was also noted that the coal-fired plants negatively affect neighboring countries; under the Espoo Convention on EIA in a Transboundary Context, transboundary air pollution requires an IEA and a notification of neighboring countries about potential transboundary pollution from coal power plants.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>According to the communication, the situation raises serious concerns about both BiH and China’s failure to meet “international human rights obligations for human and environmental rights.” This includes the human rights to a healthy environment, life, health, bodily integrity, safe drinking water and sanitation. Moreover, the construction and operation of the new coal fired power plants “exacerbate the already dangerous conditions of climate change by adding, and failing to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.” Several procedural environmental human rights were affected too, due to alleged failures to provide adequate information, access to justice and effective remedies on negative health impacts resulting from the plant’s emissions.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>States bear obligations under the international human rights law framework to protect against human rights abuse within their territories and/or jurisdiction, by third parties, including business enterprises. Meeting these obligations requires States to take appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish, and redress any abuse through effective policies, legislation, regulations, and adjudication, including in the sphere of environmental protection. The international legal instruments which form the basis for obligations are set out in an Annex, and include protection of aforementioned rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, and Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on Rights of the Child, the UNECE Aarhus Convention, the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and Environment, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The communication reiterates applicability of HRC General Comment No. 36 on the right to life with dignity to environmental degradation, pollution and climate change (paras. 26, 62) and the importance of protecting underlying environmental determinants of health under Article 14 ICESCR and 24 CRC, and related general comments.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>Communications of the Special Procedures are not binding and cannot afford direct remedies, but the communication asked both BiH and China to, inter alia: (a) indicate measures to ensure how the plants comply with applicable national law, international environmental laws, and international human rights standards, including the right to information; (b) harmonize procedures for environmental permitting and regulation systems, including by conducting environmental human rights impact assessments based on comprehensive and consistent standards; (c) provide information and monitor negative health impacts of the plant; and (d) prevent negative human rights and environmental outcomes, e.g. by enforcing the polluter pays principle. It asked China to provide information on the impacts and damages of the pollution caused by Chinese-supported coal powered plants on global climate change, the environment and local communities; or to provide information on measures to ensure that projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative contribute to the decarbonization of the host states of projects and do not compromise mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change.<br>&nbsp;BiH did not respond to the communication. China replied on May 27, 2021, by stating that “allegations of human rights violations by the project in question are not based on fact; they are purely false accusations.” According to China, it actively assumes international responsibility for climate change, including to the Green Silk Road. It always requires enterprises to carry out foreign projects in compliance with the laws of countries or regions where they are located, and financial institutions abide by the concept of green credit. Specifically, the Tuzla plant is intended to replace outdated local units, and meet environmental requirements under EU carbon emissions standards, with positive benefits for the environment and ‘huge’ local social and economic benefit through development and reliable energy supply.<br><br>"

The request acknowledged the human rights effects of the climate emergency, especially highlighting the vulnerability of communities and ecosystems in Latin America. In this line, Colombia and Chile emphasized the need for regional standards to accelerate action to confront climate change. The applicants mentioned the Advisory Opinion OC-23/17 requested by Colombia, where the IACtHR recognized the right to a healthy environment and the relation between environment and human rights. The request identifies the IACtHR as the suitable body to determine guidelines for creating and implementing climate policies based on a human rights approach.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Colombia and Chile's petition refers to various topics. First, the applicants asked about the state obligations derived from preventing and guaranteeing human rights to confront climate emergencies. In this sense, the applicants enquired the Court about the scope of the prevention duty of states against extreme and slow onset climate effects in the light of the Paris Agreement and the scientific consensus not to trespass the 1.5 degrees of global temperature. Along the same line, the applicants asked about which actions states should take against the damages provoked by climate impacts and which differentiated measures should be taken to protect vulnerable communities. Specifically, Colombia and Chile requested the Court to refer to actions regarding regulation, monitoring, environmental impact assessment, contingency plans and mitigation of activities that can worsen the climate emergency. In this line, the applicants asked the IACtHR about the principles that should 'inspire' these actions, especially regarding adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Second, the requesting states focused on the state obligation to preserve the right to life against the climate emergency in the light of human rights and science standards. Here, the applicants requested an opinion regarding the scope of substantive and procedural obligations on human rights and the environment. The applicants especially asked the Court about the importance of protecting the right to access information to guarantee other human rights, such as the right to life, property, health and participation.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Third, the applicants requested an opinion from the Court to clarify the differentiated obligations of the states to protect the rights of children and future generations from climate change. Here, Colombia and Chile mentioned articles 1, 4, 5, 11 and 19 of the American Convention and asked about the nature and scope of the right of children to access justice to present judicial actions for preventing potentially damaging effects of climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Fourth, following the clarification of the scope of procedural obligations, Chile and Colombia asked the IACtHR to clarify the nature of the obligations of the states to provide judicial actions for adequate protection and reparation of the rights affected by the climate emergency. In the same sense, the applicants asked about the necessity to implement the obligation to consult for the climate consequences of certain activities.<br><br></div><div>Fifth, the applicants focused on environmental defenders' protection, referring to the American Convention and the Escazú Agreement. Here, the applicants focused on the obligations that states should comply with for protecting environmental defenders, especially indigenous people and women, for protecting ecosystems in the context of the climate emergency.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Finally, Colombia and Chile focused on asking the IACtHR about the cooperation between states to confront climate change in the region, especially to clarify the shared and differentiated obligations amongst the region's nations.

Bord Na Móna Allen Peat Limited and others engaged in peat extraction and transport were also parties to the case. At issue was whether the approval granted to Edenderry had complied with the EU’s Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which was incorporated into Irish law in 2010. An Taisce argued that the approval had not because it had considered only the impacts of the plant’s operations but not those resulting from the peat extraction and transport involved in supplying the bulk of the plant’s feedstock. Edenderry and the other respondents countered that because neither the peat nor plant operations were contingent upon one another they were unrelated for the purposes of environmental review.&nbsp;<br><br>The High Court, noting that it was required to base its decision on the “actual reality of the project” at issue, rejected Edenderry’s arguments as theoretical—the permit application, after all, contemplated sourcing from these particular bogs, such that any other approach would constitute a material change to the application. Thus, “[t]here is functional interdependence as the power plant relies for the vast majority of its raw material on the designated bogs.” The court also noted that it made no difference that the bogs were independently subject to an air pollution licensing regime. The planning authority, it explained, “is entitled to take the licenses into account” when assessing the impacts of the peat extraction operations."

The court declined to grant any of the relief sought by plaintiffs because they failed to assert a viable claim for standing. However, in a historic first, the High Court issued a judgment recognizing “a personal constitutional right to an environment” under the Irish Constitution. Despite finding a lack of standing, the High Court issued a comprehensive review of the merits in anticipation of a future appeal.<br><br></div><div>The High Court declared that, “A right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large is an essential condition for the fulfilment of all human rights. It is an indispensable existential right that is enjoyed universally, yet which is vested personally as a right that presents and can be seen always to have presented, and to enjoy protection, under Art. 40.3.1° of the Constitution.” The Court elaborated that this right was not so “Utopian” as to prevent enforcement, but would rather become enforceable once made concrete through the definition and demarcation of specific duties and obligations. The High Court explained that recognizing this previously unenumerated constitutional right was a first step in this process to define and demarcate a right to an environment.<br><br></div><div>However, the High Court did not find that the Fingal County Council violated this newly recognized right to an environment by extending the planning permission for the runway. The Court explained, “. . . even though the court accepts that members of the [Friends of Irish Environment] enjoy the contended-for constitutional right, and that the [Friends of the Irish Environment] itself has standing as a body corporate, and has a sufficient basis to contend for recognition of that existing but unenumerated constitutional right, the [Friends of the Irish Environment] nevertheless did not have a right to participate in the extension decision under [Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000] (there is no such right of participation) and it has failed to establish that there is, by reference to that section and on the facts presenting, any disproportionate interference with the personal constitutional right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large. In truth, the court sees in [Section 42] nothing more than a proper and proportionate legislative interference with the said, ever-present and now expressly recognised personal constitutional right.”<br><br></div><div>Further, the High Court ruled that Friends of the Irish Environment did not fulfill standing requirements under section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, Article 11 of the Consolidated EIA Directive, or the “Aarhus Convention” (i.e. the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters adopted on 25th June 1998 in the Danish city of Aarhus). The High Court found that neither the Planning and Development Act 2000 nor the Consolidated EIA contained requirements for further public participation in granting an extension of a planning permission. Claims concerning the original decision to grant a planning permission in 2007 were deemed impermissible collateral attacks.<br><br></div><div>The Court did not find that the Section 15 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 changed the substance of Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act in a way relevant to the claims of this case. Section 15 creates an obligation that ""A relevant body shall, in the performance of its functions, have regard to . . . the furtherance of the national transition objective, and the objective of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change in the State."" The High Court said that the Fingal Council would only need to provide reasons if it elected to entirely depart from the objectives of Section 15. The High Court did not believe this this sort of departure was present in the case at hand."

FIE alleged that the National Mitigation Plan (""the Plan""), which seeks to transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050, is inconsistent with the Act and Ireland's human rights commitments because it is not designed to achieve substantial short-term emissions reductions. The case was argued before the High Court on January 22, 2019. FIE asked the High Court to quash the government's decision to approve the Plan and, if appropriate, order that a new plan be written.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On September 19, 2019, the Court ruled for the government. The Court rejected FEI's claim that the Plan was invalid for failing to achieve substantial short-term emissions reductions, concluding that the Act does not require particular intermediate targets. The Court recognized that ""there is now limited room, or . . . carbon budget, for greenhouse gas emissions"" given the ""safe temperature rise target"" of 1.5 degrees Celsius. The Court reasoned, however, that the government appropriately exercised policy making discretion afforded by the Act, explaining that the current Plan is only an initial step in achieving targets for transitioning to a low-carbon, climate resilient, and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050, and will be subject to review and revision. The Court concluded that FEI had standing to bring rights-based claims, but rejected the argument that the government had violated Ireland's Constitution and commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights because the Plan is ""but one, albeit extremely important, piece of the jigsaw.""&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On November 22, 2019, FEI appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal. FEI also submitted an application to leapfrog the traditional appeal route and go directly to the Supreme Court. On February 13, 2020 the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, determining that exceptional circumstances warranted direct appeal. The Court explained that, ""[t]he applicant and the respondents accept that there exists a degree of urgency in respect of the adoption of remedial environmental measures. There is no dispute between the parties as to the science underpinning the Plan and the likely increase in greenhouse emissions over the lifetime of the Plan.""<br><br>On July 31, 2020, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court and issued a ruling quashing the Plan. The Court unanimously determined that the Plan falls short of the sort of specificity that the Act requires because a reasonable reader of the Plan would not understand how Ireland will achieve its 2050 goals. The Court explained that ""a compliant plan must be sufficiently specific as to policy over the whole period to 2050."" The Court, however, determined that FIE lacks standing to bring its claims under the Constitution or ECHR. The Court also concluded that FIE had not made a compelling enough case for identifying an unenumerated right to a healthy environment, separate from the rights expressly conferred by the Irish Constitution, ""[w]hile not ruling out the possibility that constitutional rights and obligations may well be engaged in the environmental field in an appropriate case."""

Ten National Strategic Outcomes were identified: Compact Growth, Enhanced Regional Accessibility, Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities, High Quality International Connectivity, Sustainable Mobility, A Strong Economy, Enhanced Amenities and Heritage, Transition to Sustainable Energy, Sustainable Management of Water, Waste and other environmental resources, and Access to Quality Child Care, Education and Health Services.

The group challenged the NPF on a number of grounds, including that the Government failed to assess the NPF's effects on climate change when preparing the SEA. The complaint alleged that the government was required to not only identify the likely increases in greenhouse gas emissions that would occur under the NPF, but also analyze the climate impacts of those emissions. The court rejected this claim, reasoning that a quantitative assessment of the NPF's likely effect on climactic factors is not feasible because the NPF is a policy document that does not permit any specific development or project. The court further reasoned that the NPF does contain provisions designed to reduce the effects of climate change that the NPF causes. The court concluded that the SEA's consideration of climate change was therefore sufficient."

In this judgment, the Osaka High Court discussed whether the appellants had standing under administrative law and whether the Notice of Finalization was illegal. Regarding the first point of the dispute, the court stated that there must a legally protected individual interest to have standing under administrative law. While the court recognized the standing of the appellants in relation to air pollution, the court ruled that the interest of the appellants do not include climate damage and that CO2 emissions are not recognized as a legally protected interest in the current society. The court further states that this interest should be pursued in the policy-making process as a general public interest. However, the court does not deny the possibility of a future change in this interpretation. If there is a change in the social situation or understanding, the interest to not incur damage through climate change and the CO2 emissions may be recognized as a legally protected individual interest.<br><br></div><div>Regarding the second point, the legality of the Notice of Finalization, the court was not able to determine its legality based on the CO2 emissions as this was a policy issue. Moreover, concerning the lack of consideration of PM 2.5 emissions and concerns related to the emissions of other pollutants, the court stated that there was no deviation nor abuse of the discretionary power. Thus, the Notice of Finalization was legal. The citizens expressed their intent to further bring the case to the Supreme Court.<br><br>"

The complaints allege that SMBC, MUFG and Mizuho are in breach of OECD guidelines because they failed to provide environmental and social impact assessments and consequently failed to urge project sponsors to assess and prevent or minimize environmental damage. They claim that the project’s emissions intensity (estimated at 860-880g CO2/kWh) is of an unacceptably high level by international standards, and would generate twice as much CO2 per unit of power generated as the average electricity generating plant in Vietnam. In addition they allege that banks were made aware about the environmental impacts of the project, but there is no evidence that they took any steps to influence their client to disclose additional environmental information or to implement additional mitigation measures that would reduce the project’s emissions.

The plaintiffs argued that the operation of the Sendai Power Station violated (i) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity (Jinkaku-ken) due to the health damage caused by the emission of environmental pollutants, (ii) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity due to climate change, and (iii) the right to maintain biodiversity due to the emission of hazardous substances. Firstly, the plaintiffs argued that the emissions of pollutants, such as SOx and NOx, caused significant health damage by increasing the risks of various illnesses. Secondly, the plaintiffs argued that their personal rights were violated as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would worsen climate change, which causes extreme events, such as heat waves and heavy rains. To support this argument, they stated that the current use of coal-fired power plants was incompatible with the GHG emissions reduction targets in Japan and was also an obstacle to the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Thirdly, the plaintiffs claimed that environmental rights, including the right to maintain biodiversity, should be recognized based on Article 13 of the Constitution.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Those three arguments are later modified to the tort claims based on the right to a peaceful life, which they claimed was violated by environmental pollution, personal rights concerning life and bodily integrity, which they claimed were violated by climate change, and the right to maintain biodiversity. During the proceedings, the right to maintain biodiversity was excluded from the points of dispute by the parties based on the Court’s determination that the right to maintain biodiversity is not recognized under Japanese civil law. Similarly, the plaintiffs indicated in the 10th preparatory document that they withdrew their claim based on the personal rights to life and bodily integrity, and thus, the second argument related to climate change was removed from the points of dispute.<br><br></div><div>On October 28, 2020, the Sendai District Court delivered a judgment, which solely discussed the right to a peaceful life focusing on environmental pollution. The Court rejected the plaintiffs’ claim by saying that neither the nature nor the level of environmental pollution was serious and that the evidence provided by the plaintiffs lacked objectivity and credibility. The court did not rule on GHG emissions because they were part of the second argument, which were modified before the ruling. The Court further mentioned that the business operator had social accountability to do its best to relieve the citizens’ concerns about environmental pollution.<br><br></div><div>On December 22, 2020, one citizen filed an appeal. In the statement of appeal, the appellant claimed that the district court has made 5 errors. Firstly, he claimed that the court misinterpreted the initial complaint by equating the mental distress with the threat to life and bodily integrity, which was claimed by the plaintiffs. Secondly, he claimed that the court had misunderstood the scientific concepts and terms and thus failed to recognize the risks based on the scientific evidence. Thirdly, he claimed that the court should still have considered the issues of global warming and GHG emissions either as factors to counteract the public necessity of the power plant or as aggravating factors of the tort even if the violation of the plaintiffs’ rights by global warming was not discussed since the CO2 emission by the power plant was against the generally accepted idea in the modern society and national carbon neutral policies. Fourthly, he claimed that the court misinterpreted the expert’s opinion concerning the concentration of PM 2.5 and thus failed to recognize the health risks. Lastly, he claimed that the court ignored the precedents and academic theories related to personal rights and air pollution. He argued that there was no public necessity for a new power plant and the protection of personal rights should be prioritized.<br><br></div><div>On April 27, 2021, Sendai High Court issued a judgment on the appeal. The parties did not dispute that the power plant could cause the emission of air pollutants. Thus, the issue discussed was whether the threat of damage to the appellant’s life and bodily integrity by the health impact due to the exposure to the air pollutants could be recognized as a violation of personal rights (either the physical rights or the right to a peaceful life) leading to the illegality of the operation of the power plant. The court ruled that while it could not deny that there was abstract danger, there was no sufficient evidence to recognize concrete danger to the appellant’s health. The amounts of emissions of PM 2.5 and NOx are within the normal range and the amounts of other pollutants, including mercury, were all lower than the environmental standards. The court believes that there is no indication that air pollution has worsened after the power plant started operating. As for the public necessity, the presence of surplus at one moment does not mean that there was no public necessity for the power plant since power demand and supply are easily influenced by various circumstances. Moreover, considering the current energy policy, usability and public nature of the power plant concerned cannot be denied while there is discussion and governmental policies to prevent global warming, such as ‘2050 Carbon-Neutral’. Further, the court adds that no concrete danger to global warming nor biodiversity is recognizable. The court rejected the appeal and supported the first instance judgment. The court cannot find concrete danger, which exceeds the socially acceptable upper limits, to health when considering the nature and level of damage, the social usability, public nature, and preventive measures.<br><br>"

The two policies challenged were the National Centre of Energy Control (CENACE) Agreement ""to ensure the efficiency, quality, reliability, continuity and safety of the National Electric System, on the occasion of the COVID-19 epidemic"" and the Ministry of Energy policy of ""Reliability, Security, Continuity and Quality in the National Electrical System.""

The government appealed the decision to the First Circuit Collegiate Tribunal.<br><br></div><div>The Court decided the contested acts were unconstitutional. First, authorities were not competent to issue the policies. Furthermore, the policies violate the human right to a healthy environment, as well as (i) the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (ii) the Kyoto Protocol, and (iii) the Paris Agreement (all ratified by Mexico), by imposing a policy that displaces renewable energies, which prevents Mexico from meeting the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions targets to which it committed. The Court considered that the production and consumption of fossil fuels affect the environment to a greater extent, due to the amount of GHG and compounds they produce. The implementation of its provisions undoubtedly implies a risk of damage to the right to a healthy environment, since it encourages the operation of conventional power plants that generate a greater amount of emissions that pollute the environment. The risk of environmental damage is projected in both dimensions (individual and collective), since, on the one hand, it can affect individual health of people and, on the other hand, it does not contribute to mitigate the effects of climate change, which impacts on the universal interest owed to present and future generations to preserve and protect natural resources. Finally, the policies also imply the implementation of regressive measures in relation to the right to a healthy environment, because instead of contributing to increase the goals of minimum participation of clean energies in the generation of electric energy, they reduce or inhibit their progress. The principles upon which the judge based his decision are: (i) in dubio pro natura, (ii) civic participation, (iii) non-regression principle and, (iv) the inclusion of future generations in the notion of progress (any unjustified and significant decrease in the level of environmental protection achieved will affect the heritage to be passed on to the next generation).<br><br>"

The NGO argued that the NDC failed to respect the principle of non-regression in human rights law. In its original 2015 NDC, Mexico committed to a 22% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 as compared to 2000 levels. In the revised NDC presented in December 2020, Mexico raised the baseline against which the GHG emission reduction is measured. Greenpeace argued that the updated NDC would effectively cause the additional emission of 14 million tons of CO2e; (ii) eliminate the peak of GHG emissions stipulated for 2026; (iii) rule out the 50% reduction target for 2050, which would nullify the mitigation horizon in the medium and long term. Greenpeace asked the court to suspend the effects of the 2020 NDC.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On July 14, 2021, the Judge ruled against Greenpeace. On July 30, 2021, Greenpeace appealed the decision.

The Treasury Bill established a tax on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) produced by stationary sources. A corporation dedicated to beer production sued the state legislature, challenging the constitutionality of the Treasury Bill of the State of Zacatecas. Specifically, the corporation argued that the State of Zacatecas was invading the national Congress’s powers by introducing the tax. On October 31, 2017, the Second District Judge in the State of Zacatecas agreed that state authorities could not tax GHG emissions without overstepping on Congress’s power. Particularly, the judge pointed to the fact that the Mexican Constitution reserves imposition of taxes on beers to federal authorities. Thus, it declared the taxes unconstitutional. State authorities appealed the decision to the appellate Collegiate Tribunal, and the Collegiate Tribunal sent the case to the Supreme Court for review.<br><br></div><div>On February 20, 2020, the Supreme Court concluded that States were not prevented from implementing taxes on GHG emissions since, as a general rule, Federal and State authorities have joint powers to establish taxes unless the Mexican Constitution reserves a specific area to the federation. The Court noted that the tax on GHG emissions under analysis was not a tax on beer production but rather on the emission, deposition, or storage of substances in the atmosphere. The Court also noted that the State had acted pursuant to its responsibilities under Mexico’s General Law on Ecologic Equilibrium and Environment Protection and the General Law on Climate Change.<br><br></div><div>Responding to other arguments from the corporation, the Court noted that the tax intended to force polluters to internalize the costs of their GHG emitting activities, and this was a valid implementation of the “polluter pays principle.” The Court also dismissed the corporation’s argument that the UNFCCC only called developed countries to take action on GHG emissions. In this sense, the Court noted that Mexican authorities have a duty to address the effects of climate change. Finally, the Court dismissed the argument that the tax was arbitrary since it only applied to GHG emissions and not to other gas emissions that also pollute the atmosphere. To do so, the Court carried out a proportionality analysis to conclude that the distinction made by the State was justified.<br><br>"

On one hand, more greenhouse gas emissions would have an impact on human health. On the other hand, the court considered that the Agreement would prevent Mexico from fulfilling its commitments under the Paris Agreement, Kyoto Protocol and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change since it limited privileged electricity generated by fossil fuels over renewable energy projects. Thus, even if there was no certainty of the degree of the risk or harm that the Agreement would cause, a proper application of the precautionary principle demands that the regulation is struck down. The Court also emphasized that in these cases, there is a reversal of the burden of proof, which forced authorities to prove that the Agreement would not cause any environmental damage. Finally, the court considered that the Agreement was contrary to the progressive nature of environmental protection envisaged by the Mexican legal system, which limited the possibility of unjustifiably reducing or modifying any already achieved level of protection. This was the case since the 2015 the Energy Transition Act orders authorities to set goals so that electricity consumption is increasingly satisfied by economically viable clean energy sources. The Act orders a minimum of 25% of the demand for electricity satisfied by clean energy sources by 2018; 30% by 2021, and 35% by 2024.<br><br></div><div>The authorities appealed the decision but the First Circuit Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications dismissed the appeal.<br><br>"

The case is yet to be decided.;20/12/2019|Decision upheld","A Dutch environmental group, the Urgenda Foundation, and 900 Dutch citizens sued the Dutch government to require it to do more to prevent global climate change. The court in the Hague ordered the Dutch state to limit GHG emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, finding the government’s existing pledge to reduce emissions by 17% insufficient to meet the state’s fair contribution toward the UN goal of keeping global temperature increases within two degrees Celsius of pre-industrial conditions. The court concluded that the state has a duty to take climate change mitigation measures due to the “severity of the consequences of climate change and the great risk of climate change occurring.” In reaching this conclusion, the court cited (without directly applying) Article 21 of the Dutch Constitution; EU emissions reduction targets; principles under the European Convention on Human Rights; the “no harm” principle of international law; the doctrine of hazardous negligence; the principle of fairness, the precautionary principle, and the sustainability principle embodied in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the principle of a high protection level, the precautionary principle, and the prevention principle embodied in the European climate policy. The court did not specify how the government should meet the reduction mandate, but offered several suggestions, including emissions trading or tax measures.

The court recognized Urgenda’s claim under Article 2 of the ECHR, which protects a right to life, and Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to private life, family life, home, and correspondence. The court determined that the Dutch government has an obligation under the ECHR to protect these rights from the real threat of climate change. The court rejected the government’s argument that the lower court decision constitutes “an order to create legislation” or violation of trias politica and the role of courts under the Dutch constitution. In response to these appeals, the court affirmed its obligation to apply provisions with direct effect of treaties to which the Netherlands is party, including Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. Further, the court found nothing in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that prohibits a member state from taking more ambitious climate action than the E.U. as a whole, nor that adaptation measures can compensate for the government’s duty of care to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, nor that the global nature of the problem excuses the Dutch government from action.<br><br></div><div>The Dutch government appealed the decision, and the Netherlands' Supreme Court heard the appeal on May 24, 2019.

The underlying argument is that Shell has a duty to take action to reduce GHG emissions based on Art. 6:162 of the Dutch Civil Code (duty of care and human rights obligations by failing to take adequate action to curb contributions to climate change).|;26/05/2021|District Court Judgment|The Hague District Court rules in favour of NGO plaintiffs|;23/08/2021|Case appealed|Shell appealed against the court order|","On Monday, April 5th, 2019, the environmental group Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth Netherlands and co-plaintiffs served Shell a court summons alleging Shell’s contributions to climate change violate its duty of care under Dutch law and human rights obligations. The case was filed in the Hague Court of Appeals. Co-plaintiffs include other NGOs (ActionAid NL, Both ENDS, Fossielvrij NL, Greenpeace NL, Young Friends of the Earth NL, Waddenvereniging) and more than 17000 citizens. The plaintiffs seek a ruling from the court that Shell must reduce its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels and to zero by 2050, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>This case builds on the landmark Urgenda decision which found that the Dutch government’s inadequate action on climate change violated a duty of care to its citizens. In the suit against Shell, plaintiffs extend this argument to private companies, arguing that given the Paris Agreement’s goals and the scientific evidence regarding the dangers of climate change, Shell has a duty of care to take action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Plaintiffs base this duty of care argument on Article 6:162 of the Dutch Civil Code as further informed by Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which guarantee rights to life (Article 2) and rights to a private life, family life, home, and correspondence (Article 8). Plaintiffs’ argument outlines how Shell’s long knowledge of climate change, misleading statements on climate change, and inadequate action to reduce climate change help support a finding of Shell’s unlawful endangerment of Dutch citizens and actions constituting hazardous negligence.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In November 2019, Shell submitted a Statement of Defense. Shell argued, among other defenses, that there is no legal standard, statutory or otherwise, that would establish that Shell is acting in conflict with an unwritten legal standard by failing to comply with emissions caps. Shell also argued that plaintiffs' claims are too general to fall within the scope of ECHR Articles 2 and 8.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In September and October 2020, the parties provided their evidence for factual and legal justification. Four days of hearings were then held on 1, 3, 15 and 17 December 2020.

The Court wrote that it ""orders [Royal Dutch Shell (“RDS”)], both directly and via the companies and legal entities it commonly includes in its consolidated annual accounts and with which it jointly forms the Shell group, to limit or cause to be limited the aggregate annual volume of all CO2 emissions into the atmosphere (Scope 1, 2 and 3) due to the business operations and sold energy-carrying products of the Shell group to such an extent that this volume will have reduced by at least net 45% at end 2030, relative to 2019 levels."" In other words, the Court ordered Shell to reduce emissions by a net 45% across both emissions from its own operations and emissions from the use of the oil it produces. The Court made its decision provisionally enforceable, meaning Shell will be required to meet its reduction obligations even as the case is appealed.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In its decision, the Court allowed the class action by Milieudefensie, Greenpeace NL, Fossielvrij NL, Waddenvereniging, Both ENDS, and Young Friends of the Earth NL because the interests served in the class action aligned with the objectives stated in their articles of association. The Court rejected claims by ActionAid, because its operations were not geared toward Dutch citizens, and individual claimants, because their interests were already served by the class action and they did not present independent interests.<br><br></div><div>The Court wrote ""RDS’ reduction obligation ensues from the unwritten standard of care laid down in Book 6 Section 162 Dutch Civil Code, which means that acting in conflict with what is generally accepted according to unwritten law is unlawful."" Plaintiffs had argued that, stemming from this standard of care, Shell had an obligation to prevent dangerous climate change through its policies, and the Court applied the standard of care to the company's policies, emissions, consequences of its emissions, and its human rights and international and regional legal obligations. The Court concluded that the standard of care included the need for companies to take responsibility for Scope 3 emissions, especially ""where these emissions form the majority of a company’s CO2 emissions, as is the case for companies that produce and sell fossil fuels.""<br><br></div><div>In applying this standard of care to Shell, the Court concluded that it must reduce its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, across its entire energy portfolio, by 45% by 2030, relative to 2019 emission levels. The Court gave Shell flexibility in allocating emissions cuts between Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, so long as in aggregate, the total emissions were reduced by 45%. The Court wrote, ""With respect to the business relations of the Shell group, including the end-users, this constitutes a significant best-efforts obligation, in which context RDS may be expected to take the necessary steps to remove or prevent the serious risks ensuing from the CO2 emissions generated by them, and to use its influence to limit any lasting consequences as much as possible. A consequence of this significant obligation may be that RDS will forgo new investments in the extraction of fossil fuels and/or will limit its production of fossil resources.""<br><br></div><div>The Court rejected arguments by Shell that the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) preempted further emissions cuts ordered by the court, and arguments that the reduction obligation would have no effect. The Court rejected the ETS argument on the grounds that the ETS only applies to some of the emissions in Europe Shell is responsible for, and the ETS does not cover emissions outside the EU. The standard of care, on the other hand, requires Shell to reduce all global emissions that will harm Dutch citizens. Further, the Court rejected the claim that a reduction obligation would have no effect because such emissions would be substituted by other companies. The Court wrote that it remains to be seen whether other companies will substitute Shell production in the face of Paris Agreement obligations and noted the causal relationship between production limitation and emissions reduction. The Court wrote, ""The court acknowledges that RDS cannot solve this global problem on its own. However, this does not absolve RDS of its individual partial responsibility to do its part regarding the emissions of the Shell group, which it can control and influence.""<br><br>Shell began appeal proceedings of the decision on August 23, 2021, on the grounds that addressing climate change needs co-ordination and that the court did not take into account its Powering Progress strategy released earlier this year. Shell filed its statement of appeal with the Dutch Court of Appeal in The Hague on March 22, 2022.&nbsp;<br><br>On April 25, 2022, Milieudefensie sent a letter to Shell’s Board of Directors calling for urgent action to comply with the verdict of May 26, 2021 and warning for personal liability risks towards third parties resulting from a failure to act."

Applicants argued that CO2 was not accounted for at all, but that the burning of wood pellets in this new biomass facility would lead to more CO2 emissions per unit of generated energy than a coal-fired plant. This increases the atmospheric concentration of CO2, accelerating global warming. They also argued that this violates the Paris Agreement, EU law and the national Climate Law.<br><br></div><div><br></div><div>On June 7, 2021, the District Court of North Holland ruled that the arguments of applicants related to CO2 emissions are not relevant to the permit procedure, since no evidence was presented on the direct and specific effects of CO2 emissions or global warming on the municipality of Diemen and it inhabitants. The evidence mostly referred to worldwide effects of CO2 emissions on the climate, rather than specific effects of the operation of the new biomass facility on the (direct) environment of the facility. Moreover, the court stated that, as affirmed in the Urgenda-case, the Paris Agreement lacks direct effects in the Dutch legal order. Third parties cannot directly derive rights or legal obligations from it. Even so, it is up to the Dutch government to decide which measures it takes to meet its climate targets, and the government has motivated its decision to pursue biomass on the basis because it views this fuel as necessary for the energy transition, and biomass is viewed as a CO2-neutral ‘renewable energy source’ under the Paris Agreement. The court explicitly states that the ‘political-governance’ choice to use biomass as a transitional fuel, and whether this is indeed a suitable fuel that would allow States to meet their climate targets is not an aspect that can be considered during a permit procedure, or assessed by a court in a related procedure. Since biomass is considered a CO2-neutral energy source under the Paris Agreement, the court decides not to consider the applicants’ arguments and calculations related to CO2 emissions, definitions of biomass under REDD I and REDD II, carbon debt, regeneration periods for wood stocks, and carbon capture and storage.

In 2019, the Dutch government had adopted the Prohibition of Coal in Electricity Production Act to help implement its obligations under international climate law. The law provides that coal-fired power stations may no longer use coal as a fuel to generate electricity in the long term (by 2030 at the latest). The law aims to reduce CO₂ emissions from power plants.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The case was brought by German energy companies owning three major coal-fired power plants in the Netherlands, stating that the law infringes on their property rights because it was introduced without offering a financial compensation scheme. The energy companies had filed claims of EUR 1.4 billion and EUR 1 billion respectively against the Dutch state, claiming the ban on coal-fired power generation by 2030 was a form of expropriation in violation of their right to property in Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the right to property in Article 17 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. According to European human rights law, these provisions protect the right to property of both natural and legal persons.<br><br></div><div>The District Court ruled that whilst the law indeed infringes the right to property of the energy companies, this infringement is not unlawful. In light of the established case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the District Court determines whether the Prohibition of Coal in Electricity Act follows the criteria for a lawful interference with the right to property. These criteria include the so-called ‘fair balance’ test, encompassing consideration of the nature and scale of the interference – including whether the measure entails a ‘de facto expropriation’ which would normally be eligible for compensation – and its proportionality, necessity. and foreseeability. In terms of expropriation, the Court applied a strict test following from ECHR case-law and a previous Dutch Supreme Court ruling. Notably: de facto expropriation does not exist in situations where, even ‘if a measure leads to the termination of the company, the entitled party retains any economic interest or a meaningful possibility to use (assets of) the company’. The Court decided that there are evidently several financial interests in continued use of the power plants, including as they may be reconverted to using other fuels, such as biomass. The measure did not amount to expropriation, instead, it fell with the sphere of lawful regulation of companies, which does not necessitate compensation per se.<br><br></div><div>The District Court further decided that the measures taken by Dutch State to reduce CO₂ emissions are proportional and that the interests of the owners have been sufficiently taken into account when adopting the law. According to the Court, the ban on use of coal was also foreseeable for the owners, especially if GHG emissions from power stations had not been reduced very significantly before 2020, for example by switching to biomass or by capturing CO₂. Such measures were not undertaken by the companies at their MPP3 power station and the Eemshaven power station. On the other hand, the Amer power plant already runs almost entirely on biomass. The owner of the latter station could have foreseen that this power station would not be allowed to be revert back to coal once a subsidy for use of (woody) biomass terminates at the end of 2027.<br><br></div><div>The Court also attached importance to the fact that there had been significant international and national societal debate on these issues, signaling that curbs on coal fired electricity were to be expected in the near future. Specifically, companies could not have expected new coal-fired electricity plants that were planned from 2009 onwards to operate without any limitations until 2040. In addition, the prohibition on use of coal would not take effect immediately after the entry into force of the law. Owners are given a transition period during which they can still realize revenues from coal-fired power and limit their damage. In addition, they can use this period to investigate other uses for the power plants, and invest in conversion to biomass. Overall, a ‘fair balance’ was struck between the property rights of these energy companies, as associated with their coal-fired electricity plants, and the general public interest. The Prohibition on Coal in Electricity Production Act, demanding that companies phase out coal use by 2030, does not place an ‘individual and excessive burden’ on the energy companies.<br><br>Full case documents will be added as they become available.&nbsp;"

That Act implements New Zealand’s responsibilities as a ratifying Annex I member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It requires the Minister to set an emissions reduction target in keeping with the statements of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and to consider whether to revise that target as the IPCC issues updated findings. In March 2011, pursuant to the 2002 Act, the Minister had set a target of 50% reduction from 1990 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels by 2050. The Minister did not review or revise that target following the 2014 issuance of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. In July 2015, in advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Paris, the Minister submitted New Zealand’s intended nationally determined contribution (INDC)--and then subsequently a nationally determined contribution (NDC)--consistent with a “provisional target” of only 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. As Thomson's Statement of Claim noted, “this equates to a reduction of 11% below New Zealand’s 1990 emission levels by 2030,” and thus “will not, if adopted by other developed countries in combination with appropriate targets set by developing countries, stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Thus Thompson challenged both the target set pursuant to the 2002 law and the target set as part of New Zealand's NDC pursuant to the United National Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, both ratified by New Zealand.<br><br></div><div>The High Court of New Zealand issued its decision after the 2017 election had ousted the prior government, replacing it with a government whose members had campaigned on a commitment to eliminate all GHG emissions by 2050. Nonetheless, the court reviewed both the 2030 and 2050 targets set by the prior government's Minister and ruled on their legality. With respect to the 2050 target, the court determined that although the Minister had discretion under the 2002 act to review and determine New Zealand's emissions reduction target for 2050, that discretion was limited by the act's purpose and by the evidence contained in IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), both of which argued strongly for a lower national emissions target than the one set based on the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). However, because it was not clear that a review of the 2050 target in light of AR5 would certainly have led to the target's revision, and because the question was largely mooted by the recent election (""[s]uch a declaration would now be of historic interest only""), the court concluded merely that the Minister should have reviewed the target, but not that a decision to maintain the existing target after such a review would necessarily have been unlawful. With respect to the 2030 target in New Zealand's INDC and NDC, the court determined that it had authority to review the Minister's setting of that target but no grounds for invalidating it because the Minister had not made “any reviewable error for which the Court may intervene.”&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Regarding the authority of the courts to review climate change policy, the decision noted:<br><br></div><div>""It may be appropriate for domestic courts to play a role in Government decision making about climate change policy . . . The courts have not considered the entire subject matter is a “no go” area, whether because the state had entered into international obligations, or because the problem is a global one and one country’s efforts alone cannot prevent harm to that country’s people and their environment, or because the Government’s response involves the weighing of social, economic and political factors, or because of the complexity of the science. The courts have recognised the significance of the issue for the planet and its inhabitants and that those within the court’s jurisdiction are necessarily amongst all who are affected by inadequate efforts to respond to climate change. The various domestic courts have held they have a proper role to play in Government decision making on this topic, while emphasising that there are constitutional limits in how far that role may extend. The IPCC reports provide a factual basis on which decisions can be made. Remedies are fashioned to ensure appropriate action is taken while leaving the policy choices about the content of that action to the appropriate state body."""

The case is still undecided.|,"Representatives of the Mataatua District Māori Council have filed a claim and supporting memorandum in the Waitangi Tribunal, the forum where disputes over the performance of the Treaty of Waitangi between Māori and the government of New Zealand are heard and resolved. The claimants allege that New Zealand has breached its obligations to Māori by failing to implement policies that will address climate change. Specifically, the claimants allege that the Crown has breached the Treaty of Waitangi by: failing to take adequate steps to ensure that New Zealand bears its fair share of greenhouse gas emissions reductions; setting inadequate emissions reductions targets; continuing to ineffectively address New Zealand's emissions through the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZETS); failing to develop policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions outside of the NZETS; and failing to fulfil its Treaty obligations to consult with Māori over climate change policies.<br><br></div><div>Upon learning from the Tribunal Registry that the claim would be heard after 2020, the claimants filed an urgency application requesting an earlier hearing. That application seeks the following forms of relief:<br>• a declaration from the Tribunal that the government has breached its treaty obligations;<br>• a recommendation that New Zealand revise its emissions reduction targets upward to a level that corresponds with keeping the global concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 450ppm—the level that corresponds with the 2°C threshold that demarcates a stable climate from a potentially unstable one;<br>• a recommendation that New Zealand adopt different mitigation policies, including the restructuring or replacement of its Emissions Trading Scheme;<br>• a recommendation that New Zealand adopt policies that facilitate adaptation in ways specific to locations and resources relied upon by Māori.<br><br></div><div>It bases these requests for relief on several points of fact and law. The most basic of these is the relationship between sources of GHG emissions and climate changes, and the relationship between climate change and various adverse impacts on locations and resources relied upon by Māori for physical and cultural purposes. The application also points out that New Zealand’s Nationally Determined Contribution, submitted following the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, committed the country to reduce emissions by 11% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. It contrasts this target with the increase of GHG emissions in New Zealand of 24.1% relative to their 1990 levels by 2015 and the current expectation that they will increase to 30% increase by 2020. Further facts noted in the application include that New Zealand’s government encourages oil and gas exploration, controls an entity that mines coal, and controls another entity that is responsible for much of the recent conversion of forests to dairy farms. Having described the factual basis that links government policies adverse climate impacts, the claimants then point out that provisions of the Waitangi Treaty make the government responsible for the “active protection” of natural resources such as forests and fisheries on behalf of Māori. In characterizing that violation, the claimants quote from the recent decision in Juliana v. United States regarding the public trust doctrine and characterize that reasoning as relevant to their claim.<br><br>"

He claims customary interests in lands and other resources situated in or around Mahinepua in Northland, and asserts that various sites of customary, cultural, historical, nutritional and spiritual significance to him are close to the coast, on low-lying land or are in the sea. Smith brought suit against several defendants that operate facilities that emit greenhouse gas emissions, including dairy farms, a power station, and an oil refinery. Smith alleges that the defendants' contributions to climate change constitute a public nuisance, negligence, and breach of a duty cognizable at law to cease contributing to climate change.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The High Court of New Zealand Auckland Registry dismissed the first two claims, but not the third. The court concluded that Smith could not demonstrate public nuisance because the damage claimed was neither particular to him, nor the direct consequence of the defendants' actions. The court further reasoned that showing a public nuisance was difficult given that the defendants are complying with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. The court determined that Smith's negligence claim must fail because he has not shown that the defendants owed him a duty of care, concluding that the damage claimed was not reasonably foreseeable or proximately caused by their actions.<br><br></div><div>The court declined to strike the third cause of action, which alleged that the defendants have a duty to cease contributing to climate change. The court found that there were ""significant hurdles"" for Smith in persuading the court that this new duty should be recognized, but determined that the relevant issues should be explored at a trial. The court explained that ""[i]t may, for example, be that the special damage rule in public nuisance could be modified; it may be that climate change science will lead to an increased ability to model the possible effects of emissions."" The court warned, however, that it would likely be unable to provide the injunctive relief that Smith seeks, which would require a ""bespoke emission reduction scheme.""<br><br>Following the decision of the lower court, Mr Smith appealed the decisions to strike out the first two causes of action while the defendants cross appealed the court's decision that the third cause of action should proceed to trial. On October 21st, 2021, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal submitted by Mr Smith and upheld the cross appeal. The court held that tort law was not the appropriate vehicle for dealing with climate change, noting that ""every person in New Zealand — indeed, in the world — is (to varying degrees) both responsible for causing the relevant harm, and the victim of that harm."" As such the court argued that it's intervention in the issue and a determination that the conduct of the respondent companies was unlawful would introduce an ""ad hoc"" and ""arbitrary regime"", which would lack democratic legitimacy.

Furthermore, although the government had introduced an emissions trading scheme, the plaintiff argued that the overall emissions cap was set too high and contained unjustifiable exemptions.<br><br></div><div>The plaintiff advanced three causes of action.

Secondly, plaintiff alleged that the New Zealand government had breached the rights guaranteed under sections 8 and 20 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA), namely the rights to life and the rights of minorities.

Next, the Court found that the right to life claim was untenable because the plaintiff had not pointed to a “real and identifiable” risk to a specified individual. Furthermore, the minority rights claim had failed to particularize specific breaches, NZBORA s 20 does not impose positive duties on the State, and that the Crown had taken adequate steps to consider the interests of Māori. Finally, the Court found that Te Tiriti does not give rise to free-standing obligations, and that plaintiff’s claim was too wide-ranging to give rise to fiduciary Te Tiriti obligations because such obligations would untenably be owed to the public in general. Even if such duties were to be developed, they would need to rely on the common law duty advanced in the first cause of action, which the Court deemed untenable in any event.<br><br>"

The applicant argues that Shell failed to consider the environmental impact of its activities on the communities’ means of livelihood, collective survival, as well as the gas flaring’s contribution to the adverse and potentially life-threatening effects of climate change. The applicant claimed that such gas flaring activities violated the community’s rights to life and human dignity as constitutionally guaranteed by sections 33 and 34 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, and reinforced by Articles 4, 16, and 24 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (ratified and domesticated by Nigeria as Cap.

The NNPC was established by an Act of Parliament and carries on business of prospecting, mining, producing, exploring and storing persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil such as crude oil. It has offices, oil installations, oil pipelines, oil rigs and so on in different parts of Nigeria The case was brought in the Federal High Court, Lagos Division, over an oil spillage in ACHA Community of Abia State of Nigeria. The oil spillage was allegedly caused by the defendant’s negligence resulting from its pipeline, which had corroded due to lack of maintenance, had ruptured, fractured and spewed its entire Contents of persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil into surrounding streams and river of lneh/Aku, resulting in contaminating two community streams that were the major sources of water supply to the community. The plaintiff alleged that although the defendant contained the spillage on the surface, it failed to clean up or reinstate the Ineh/Aku streams/river. Furthermore, the plaintiff averred that the respondent was negligent in both the causation and containment of the oil spillage; that the spillage had harmful effect on living resources, marine life, human health and other usage of the streams.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The respondent challenged the plaintiff’s standing to sue and sought an order striking the suit. On February 9, 2006, the trial court struck out the suit for lack of locus having not suffered any injury at all, let alone any injury above every other member of the Acha community resulting from the alleged oil spillage. On January 28, 20013, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by reaffirming the trial court’s ruling. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court on March 9, 2013. On July 20, 2018, the Supreme Court unanimously granted the appeal in favor of the appellant.<br><br></div><div>The Supreme Court of Nigeria (SCN) held:<br>1. That the appellant NGO had the standing to sue the respondent, thereby liberalizing or broadening the rule of standing. The Supreme Court specifically highlighted “that public spirited individuals and organizations can bring an action in courts against relevant public authorities and private entities to demand their compliance with relevant laws and to ensure the remediation, restoration and protection of the environment.”<br>2. The Supreme Court further clarified that “Accordingly, every person, including NGOs, who bonafide seek the due performance of statutory functions or enforcement of statutory provisions or public laws, especially laws designed to protect human lives, public health and the environment, should be regarded as proper persons clothed with standing in law to request adjudication on such issues of public nuisance.”<br>3. The Supreme Court also acknowledged that recognizing public interest litigation will help address some other barriers to access to justice, as poor communities without “the financial muscle to sue” which usually and disproportionately bear the brunt of environmental and climate change problems, will have the benefit of public spirited persons and organizations fighting their cause.<br>4. The Supreme Court noted particularly, for the first time, that: “there is no gain saying in the fact that there is increasing concern about climate change, depletion of the ozone layer, waste management, flooding and global warming etc… Both nationally and internationally, countries and organizations are adopting stronger measures to protect and safeguard the environment for the benefits of the present and future … it is on account of this, inter alia, that I am of the firm view that this court, being a court of policy should expand the locus standi of the Plaintiff/Appellant to sue” – Per Aka’ahs, JSC.<br>Further, the national resources of earth… “must be protected and conserved for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning and management as appropriate” – Per Eko, JSC.<br>5. The Supreme Court also made significant strides in ‘greening’ the Nigerian Constitution and confirming the existence and enforceability of environmental human rights in Nigeria, in a manner that increases the possibility of successful climate change litigation in the country, especially by allowing public interest litigation. First, the Supreme Court held that Section 20 of the Nigerian Constitution on duty to protect the environment by the State is justiciable when read together with, and in the context of, a provision like section 4(2) of the Constitution, on the power to make laws to give effect to section 20. Second, the Supreme Court explicitly recognized for the first time, that section 33 of the Constitution which guarantees the Right to Life, implicitly includes and constitutes a fundamental rights to a clean and healthy environment for all. Third, the Supreme Court explicitly affirmed the enforceability of the environmental right in Article 24 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights as domesticated in Nigeria by the African Charter Act, Cap. A9 LFN 2004.<br><br></div><div>6. Finally, the Supreme Court decision in the above case aligns with the Constitutional Human Rights approach to Environmental and Climate Protection taken earlier by the Lower Court/Federal High Court in Jonah Gbemre vs Shell and others. It demonstrates a significant positive paradigm shift in the attitude of the Supreme Court to environmental and climate change related claims. It provides additional human rights and constitutional tools for potential climate litigation in Nigeria.<br><br>"

Their petition highlighted several key factual points:&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>-- the licenses would allow access to as-yet undeveloped fossil fuel deposits, and such development is inconsistent with the climate change mitigation required to avert global warming of 1.5°C and possibly even 2°C in excess of pre-industrial levels;<br>-- the area made accessible by the licenses would be the northernmost yet developed, and would abut the ice zone—thus rigs and tankers would be exposed to unprecedented risks of damage and spills, and their operation would deliver emissions of black carbon to the highly sensitive arctic; and<br>-- the Norwegian government will incur costs to develop the sites, and will only recoup those costs if the oil and gas they produce commands and adequately high market price.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>It situated these points in a legal context shaped most fundamentally by article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which establishes a “right to an environment that is conducive to health and to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity are maintained.” Other constitutional provisions cited in the petition as relevant to the licensing decision included those requiring government action to be consistent with: the precautionary principle; the no harm principle as it applies both domestically and to citizens of other countries; and human rights protections. The petition was filed by Young Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, together with the Grandparents Climate Campaign and Friends of the Earth Norway.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The Oslo District Court ruled in favor of the Norwegian Government on January 4, 2018. The court recognized that Article 112 of the Constitution is a rights provision, but found that the government did not violate any relevant rights because it had fulfilled the necessary duties before making the licensing decision. The court also declared that, “[e]missions of CO2 abroad from oil and gas exported from Norway are irrelevant when assessing whether the Decision entails a violation of Article 112.” In its assessment of whether the government had fulfilled its duties in regard to traditional environmental harm or other climate effects, the court noted that the Storting, (the Norwegian Parliament), had broadly agreed to open the southeast Barents Sea to licensing and had considered proposals to halt that licensing or review whether it was inappropriate in light of the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. According to the court’s decision, the involvement of the Storting could be found in itself sufficient to indicate that the duty to take measures had been fulfilled.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth appealed the decision to the Bogarting Court of Appeal. Appellants allege that “[t]he District Court erred in interpreting Article 112 in such a way that it limits the duty of the Norwegian government to guarantee the right to a healthy environment.” They argue that the court interpreted Article 112 too restrictively in reaching the determination that Norway is only responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions released within Norwegian territory.<br><br></div><div>On January 22, 2020, the Borgarting Court of Appeal affirmed the District Court's decision ruling that the oil and gas licenses are valid. The appellate court parted company with the District Court in holding that article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution applies to the environmental damages alleged, including emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of oil and gas after export, and that emissions resulting from the relevant decision cannot be considered in isolation. However, the Court of Appeal held that the threshold for a violation of article 112 is high, and courts should exercise restraint in reviewing decisions by the political branches. The Court held that the appellants could not show a violation of article 112 in this instance, particularly because it is uncertain whether and to what extent to the licenses will lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiffs appealed the decision on February 24, 2020. The Norwegian Supreme Court granted leave to appeal on April 20.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On December 22, 2020, the Supreme Court announced its decision rejecting the appeal and upholding the licenses for deep-sea extraction. Eleven of the 15 judge panel upheld the lower court's ruling. The Court reasoned that although the Norwegian constitution protects citizens from environmental and climate harms, the future emissions from exported oil are too uncertain to bar the granting of these petroleum exploration licenses.

The Petition, filed directly with the country’s Supreme Court, alleges violations of constitutionally protected fundamental rights, of the Public Trust Doctrine as it relates to Pakistan’s atmosphere and climate, and of rights relating to the environmental degradation expected to result from burning coal to generate electricity. In support of these allegations, it highlights that Pakistan’s government has acknowledged the reality and consequences of climate change with the National Climate Change Policy of 2012 and the Framework for Implementation of Climate Change Policy of 2013.<br><br></div><div>Ali maintained that exploiting the coalfields would further destabilize the climate system and infringe citizens’ constitutional rights to life, liberty, dignity, information, equal protection before the law, among others. The right to life, she argued, included an “inalienable right to a stable climate system” void of dangerous levels of CO2. Ali noted that Pakistan committed to and was bound by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. While she acknowledged that Pakistan could not solve climate change alone, she said that it must do its fair share to keep atmospheric CO2 concentrations within the safe level.<br><br></div><div>While the Petition alleges a variety of specific acts or omissions by Pakistan’s government, its chief focus is on the approval of a plan to develop coal fields located in the Thar desert region, located in the southeast corner of the country. That development is anticipated to increase Pakistani coal production from 4.5 to 60 million metric tons per year, with a commensurate increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiff argued that exploitation of the Thar coalfields would release approximately 327 billion tons of CO2, more than 1,000 times Pakistan’s previous estimate for annual GHG emissions. Coal mining in the Thar Desert would also worsen air pollution, impact water quality. It is also expected to displace residents in that region, and to lead to environmental degradation both directly (through water quality impacts) and indirectly (through air quality impacts from coal combustion). She claimed that thousands of Thari people were driven from their land in violation of their right to property, dignity, and equal protection before the law. The petition argued that Pakistan could potentially use renewable energy to power all of its energy needs, including in the transport, industrial, and agriculture sectors. Ali also sought protection for mangroves for sequestering carbon and protecting against sea level rise. As the Petition notes, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the source of investments of $1.2 billion for both coal field development and for the development of multiple coal-fired power plants in Pakistan.<br><br>"

It determined that the original decision would have been incompatible with the Master Plan of Islamabad. After rescinding the decision to allow commercial use of the properties, the Board issued notices to a number of property owners regarding their unsanctioned use of residential properties for commercial use. These notices were challenged by the petitioners and on 16th February 2015 the Islamabad High Court dismissed the petitions. The case was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.<br><br>On 20th May 2022 the Supreme Court of Pakistan issued a judgment in the case confirming the consolidated judgment of the Islamabad High Court. The Court found that the Capital Development Authority had been correct to determine that the original authorization for the conversion of the properties had been unlawful as it was not aligned with the Master Plan of Islamabad, and any deviation from that plan would have required approval by the Federal Government. The Court then went on to provide an explanation of the importance of orderly urban planning in the context of climate change. In particular the Court noted that future changes to existing urban plans would need to take climate change into account: ""It is doubtful that our early town planners were driven by climate considerations. However, climate must, in the wake of climate change, form a basic determinant of urban planning and design. Climate-resilient development in cities of all sizes is crucial for improving the well-being of people and increasing the life opportunities of future generations. Any change in the Master Plan to an urban scheme without taking account of the climate factor would be detrimental.""<br><br>The Court went on to note that climate change can impact a number of fundamental constitutional rights, including the fundamental rights to life, dignity and property guaranteed under Articles 9, 14, 18 and 23 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The Court argued that including adaptation and sustainability considerations in urban planning is essential for the protection of these rights and ordered that Pakistan's urban planning authorities should take this into account in future, stating: ""The CDA <strong>shall </strong>ensure to factor in adaptation, climate resiliency and sustainability into their plans, policies and decisions in order to protect [...] constitutional rights."""

The plaintiffs - the Morobe Provincial Government on its own behalf and on behalf of the people of Morobe - applied for a stay of the permit arguing that there was no proper review and consultation as required in the constitution and that the decisions were unreasonable as they would create irreparable environmental damages. The defendants argued for a dismissal of the application for stay.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On September 20, 2021, the judge granted the application for stay. The judge held that the plaintiffs and other members of the public were denied natural justice as the Minister failed to provide fully the information required and in easily understandable language or incorporate the matters raised in consultations or review meetings. The defendants failed to consider the climate change goals that informed the adoption of the Environment Act when issuing the permit. There was a risk of irreparable damage as the defendants failed to demonstrate how the environmental impact assessment and the permit meet the requirements of the Act. Furthermore, the permit was granted for 50 years, 20 years more than the estimate life of a mine of 30 years. Noting the global impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, the judge noted that the parties did not provide any information on whether the environmental impact assessment factors levels of CO2 emissions and impacts on local and global environment and proposed measures to minimize such emissions. As part of an EIA analysis, the court noted that the assessment should include a question on ""What climate change related risks have been identified and what adaption and mitigation programs if any have been built into the EIS and the deep sea tailings placement (DSTP) and how will that be monitored and reviewed and enforced?""

The original petition names 50 of those entities, all publicly traded corporations, as respondents. It identifies multiple sources of human rights, but draws most heavily on the UN Human Rights Commission’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.<br><br></div><div>During a conference held on December 11, 2017, the Commission accepted the petition and confirmed that they would investigate the potential human rights violations stemming from major fossil fuel companies’ contributions to climate change. The Commission announced it would hold fact-finding missions and public hearings in 2018. In March 2018, the Commission held its first public hearings to investigate the alleged responsibility of major fossil fuel companies or “carbon majors” for climate change and the potential impacts on the human rights of Filipinos.<br><br></div><div>On December 9, 2019, the Commission announced its finding that major fossil fuel companies could be held liable for climate change impacts. According to news reports, the Commission concluded that legal responsibility for climate damage is not covered by current international human rights law, but fossil fuel companies have a clear moral responsibility, and the onus falls on individual countries to pass strong legislation and establish legal liability in their courts. The Commission further found that that existing civil law in the Philippines provided grounds for action, and it may also be possible to hold companies criminally accountable “where they have been clearly proved to have engaged in acts of obstruction and willful obfuscation.” The Commission also concluded that major fossil fuel companies have an obligation to respect human rights as articulated by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.<br><br></div><div>On May 6, 2022, the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR) issued the final report of its multi-year investigation into 47 investor-owned corporations for human rights harms that result from their actions triggering climate change. Major findings in the report include:<br><br></div><div>1. Carbon Majors’ products contributed to 21.4% of global emissions (p. 99). The Carbon Majors had early awareness, notice, or knowledge of their products’ adverse impacts on the environment and climate system, at the latest, in 1965. (pp. 101-104)<br><br></div><div>2. Carbon Majors, directly by themselves or indirectly through others, singly and/or through concerted action, engaged in willful obfuscation of climate science, which has prejudiced the right of the public to make informed decisions about their products, concealing that their products posed significant harms to the environment and the climate system. (pp. 108-109)<br><br></div><div>3. In addition to liability anchored on acts of obfuscation of climate science, fossil-based companies may also be held to account by their shareholders for continued investments in oil explorations for largely speculative purposes. (p. 109)<br><br></div><div>4. All acts to obfuscate climate science and delay, derail, or obstruct this transition may be a basis for liability. At the very least, they are immoral (p. 115). Climate change denial and efforts to delay the global transition from fossil fuel dependence still persists. Obstructionist efforts are driven, not by ignorance, but by greed. Fossil fuel enterprises continue to fund the electoral campaigns of politicians, with the intention of slowing down the global movement towards clean, renewable energy. (p. 110)<br><br></div><div>5. The Carbon Majors have the corporate responsibility to undertake human rights due diligence and provide remediation (p. 110). Business enterprises, including their value chains, doing business in, or by some other reason within the jurisdiction of, the Philippines, may be compelled to undertake human rights due diligence and held accountable for failure to remediate human rights abuses arising from their business operations (pp. 113-114).<br><br>"

Specifically, GLACC sought a writ of mandamus from the court that would order government agencies to act on the provisions of two statutes pertaining to flood control: Republic Act 6716 ”the Rainwater Collector and Springs Development Law” requires each Filipino locality to have and maintain a rainwater collector to ensure fresh drinking water is available in times of flooding; Act 7160 or the Local Code of 1991, which establishes the responsibilities of local governments in relation to water management. The suit builds on the writ of kalikasan issued by the Supreme Court in 2009, which established both a Filipino right to environmental protection and a channel for seeking relief from infractions of that right. The petition alleges that noncompliance with the two statutes is rife and increasingly harmful as the Philippines ”the world's most typhoon-prone nation” experiences more frequent and severe storms and flooding. The case was settled when the defendant government departments signed a Memorandum of Understanding and submitted a workplan committing to carry out the required works."

The application sought an interdict prohibiting the respondents from proceeding with the seismic survey off the eastern coast of South Africa from 2021-2022. The seismic survey pursued by Shell and Impact Africa followed an exploration right granted on April 29, 2014. It aimed at providing imaging of the subsurface to determine whether there might be energy reserves below the sea floor. To succeed in their application, the applicants must establish: (i) at least a prima facie right (ii) a reasonable apprehension of irreparable and imminent harm of the right if the interim interdict is not granted; (iii) balance of convenience; and (iv) lack of an alternative satisfactory remedy.<br><br></div><div>On December 17, 2021, the South African High Court held a hearing on the case. The Court delivered the judgement on December 28, 2021. The Court found that these requirements for an interdict were satisfactorily met by the applicants. It ruled that the exploration right which was awarded without regard to the applicants’ right to meaningful consultation constitutes a prima facie violation of their right which deserves to be protected by way of an interim interdict. The Court agreed that there is reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm and imminent harm of the right as the seismic survey will promote extraction of fossil fuels and adversely impact climate change, the applicant communities’ cultural practices, ocean conservation, and the spiritual and sustainable use of ocean for healing and fishing purposes. It acknowledged the concern of the communities that seismic survey will lead to exploration without climate impact assessment, a development that is inconsistent with South Africa’s agreement at the 2021 COP26 to move away from hydrocarbon-based energy towards climate friendly renewables. While finding the balance of convenience to be in favour of the applicants, the Court reasoned that the financial loss that respondents, especially Shell and Impact Africa, are likely to suffer cannot compare with the adverse effects of infringement of the constitutional rights of the communities. Finally, the Court reasoned that the procedure contemplated under section 47 of the MPRDA and argued by the respondents as a remedy is unacceptable in that it is a time-consuming procedure. If followed, it would allow the continuous threat of infringement of the applicants’ rights.

Environmental NGOs and individual plaintiffs challenged the sale as a violation of the Swedish government's duty of care to its citizens to protect their right to a non-harmful climate. The plaintiffs' petition grounds this duty in the Swedish Constitution and Sweden's adoption of several international agreements—the petition thus resembles submission made in the recent Urgenda decision in the Netherlands. The petition argued that the sale would enable the expanded exploitation of lignite coal assets, resulting in emissions in excess of limits that correspond to climate stability. It further noted that Sweden committed to act to avoid breaching those limits. On this basis, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that 1) the Swedish state has breached its duty of care with the sale, and 2) the sale is illegal. The plaintiffs have also asked the court to order publication of the environmental review conducted in advance of the sale, which the government has so far withheld.

The complaint was lodged after two letters were sent to the Swedish state, one in May 2022 (to which the sitting Minister for Climate and Environment replied) and one in November 2022 following a change in government in October 2022 (to which there was no reply), where the plaintiffs outlined their requests. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the risk of the negative impacts of climate change constitutes interferences with their rights to life, private and family life, and non-discrimination under articles 2, 8, and 14 of the ECHR, respectively, as well as the right to property under article 1, protocol 1 of the ECHR. These interferences are argued to constitute rights violations since Sweden is failing to do its fair share to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration in the atmosphere to keep warming below 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial levels, by not undertaking immediate and adequate procedural and substantive measures to continuously reduce GHG emissions and enhance GHG sinks, thus failing to adequately protect the plaintiffs from adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change. In particular, the plaintiffs argue that climate change impacts in the period leading up to 2100 will be serious, especially in relation to impacts on human health, and that they are expected to be particularly affected by these impacts because expect to be alive at that time, based on the average life span in Sweden. In terms of specific impacts, the plaintiffs cite longer and more intense heatwaves causing both mild and severe health effects, shorter and more temperate winters leading to the increased spread of diseases through ticks, and changes to precipitation patterns leading to health impacts stemming from flooding, among others.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The plaintiffs question both procedural and substantive aspects of Sweden’s mitigation policy. With respect to the former, the plaintiffs argue that the state has failed to adopt sufficient and adequate procedural measures by not investigating, in line with the best available science: (i) the extent of Sweden’s fair share to reduce emissions continuously, (ii) how the fair share is to be achieved in a manner that is economically and technically feasible, and (iii) how Sweden can contribute to reduce consumption-based GHG emissions abroad, GHG emissions caused by Swedish legal persons abroad, and GHG emissions from LULUCF, as well as protecting and restoring natural carbon sinks like forests, wetlands, and oceans. The emissions in question for points (i) and (ii) are those from industrial processes, product use, fossil fuel-based energy, agriculture, and waste (IPEJA emissions).<br><br></div><div>As regards their substantive claims, the plaintiffs argue that the state has failed to take sufficient and adequate measures to: (i) continuously implement Sweden’s fair share, based on the investigations mentioned above, (ii) reduce IPEJA emissions between 2019 and 2030 by at least 9.4 or 6.5 million tons CO2-eq annually, primarily national emissions insofar as possible, and to ensure safe atmospheric GHG concentrations after 2030 under any circumstances, (iii) reduce national IPEJA emissions between 2019 and 2030 by at least 3.1 or 2.2 million tons CO2-eq annually and to ensure safe atmospheric GHG concentrations after 2030 under any circumstances, (iv) secure that GHG emissions reductions within one category is not achieved through increasing emissions in another category under any circumstances, and (v) continuously compensate annual emissions that exceed the permissible emissions, by reducing the net emissions by an equivalent amount in the following period under any circumstances, starting in 2019.<br><br></div><div>Ultimately, based on these arguments, the plaintiffs ask the court to order the state to implement its fair share of GHG emissions reductions to keep global warming below 1.5°C, by adopting sufficient and adequate procedural and substantive measures to ensure that emissions are continuously reduced and that GHG are absorbed through natural carbon sinks, in order to limit the risk of negative impacts of climate change on them.

Specifically, petitioners alleged the government had violated articles 10 (right to life), 73 (sustainability principle), and 74 (environmental protection) of the Swiss Constitution and by articles 2 and 8 ECHR. The petitioners alleged that their demographic group is especially vulnerable to the heat waves expected to result from climate change. They called upon the Swiss parliament and the relevant federal agencies to develop a regulatory approach to several sectors that would achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions of at least 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2050.

DETEC found that petitioners lacked standing because their rights were not affected as required by Article 25a (1) APA (Administrative Procedure Act, Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz,VwVG). DETEC determined that petitioners sought regulation of global CO2 emissions through general regulations rather than seeking a remedy for an infringement of their specific legal rights. DETEC further found that petitioners did not have victim status under the ECHR because they sought an injunction to serve the wider public interest of adoption of legislative reform to reduce CO2 emissions. Petitioners appealed the dismissal on May 26, 2017.<br><br></div><div>On November 27, 2018, the Swiss Federal Administrative Court rejected the appeal holding that Swiss women over 75 years of age are not exclusively affected by climate change impacts (thus echoing DETEC’s determination that the injury and remedy were not specialized to claimants). In January 2019, the claimants lodged an appeal against the judgment with Swiss Supreme Court. On May 20, 2020, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. The Court held that the plaintiffs' asserted rights had not been affected with sufficient intensity, and that the remedy they seek must be achieved through political rather than legal means.<br><br></div><div>On November 26, 2020, having exhausted all available legal remedies in Switzerland, the claimants filed an application to the European Court of Human Rights.

In assessing whether or not the sentences were manifestly excessive, the court looked at previous decisions of the court and the draft guideline from the Sentencing Council, and noted that: cheating the revenue is a major drain on the public purse, and the defendants' actions were a serious level of offending, with an enormous amount of planning. However, the court determined that those sentences were too high and reduced the sentences to 13 years, 10 years and 8 years."

The scheme required licensed electricity suppliers to pay a sum of money per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated by such systems to the installer (the feed-in tariff). The original feed-in tariff was to be fixed for 25 years, subject to the Retail Prices Index (RPI). The scheme was established and came into effect pursuant to the Feed-in Tariffs (Specified Maximum Capacity and Functions Order) 2010, SI 2010/678 and by amendments to the standard licence conditions issued to electricity suppliers. The procedure for making modifications to the licence conditions in relation to the scheme was contained in section 42 of the Energy Act 2008. In October 2011, the secretary of state issued a consultation paper. The consultation period was due to expire on 23 December. The consultation paper proposed a reduction in the feed-in tariff payable for electricity generated by small solar systems. The proposed new tariffs were to come into force from 1 April 2012 (the reference date). The new tariff was also to apply to installations installed and certified on or before 12 December 2011. Therefore those installations would only receive the current tariff until 1 April 2012. The secretary of state's assessment of impact showed a potential reduction in uptake of small solar systems of 70% between 12 December 2011 and 1 April 2012. The claimants applied for judicial review of the proposal. The judge found that the scheme did not evince an intention on behalf of parliament to allow the secretary of state to make the proposed modification, and held that that modification was therefore unlawful. The secretary of state appealed. The issue was whether the judge had erred. Consideration was given to section 41 of the 2008 act. The appeal would be dismissed. The concept of a rate of payment fixed during the period of generation by reference to the date the installation became eligible for payment had been fundamental to the scheme. It had provided an assurance as to the rate of return to an owner who paid a capital sum before the installation coming into operation, subject to an adjustment in accordance with the RPI. That the scheme had provided for a fixed rate of return during the period of generation was a critical consideration. The structure of the scheme had fixed the rate by reference to the year the installation had became eligible for payment. It had not provided for a rate which might fluctuate according to the yearly decisions of the secretary of state, irrespective of the year when the installation became eligible. It was not possible to recognise in the standard licence conditions or elsewhere a scheme in which the tariffs might have varied, without regard to the date when the installation became eligible and without any indication within the scheme of what amount the owner of the installation might have received, or as to how it had to be calculated. The scheme had provided for a predetermined rate, not such rate as from time to time might have been determined. In those circumstances, a modification of the feed-in tariff payment rate, in respect of installations which had become eligible before the modification, would have a retrospective effect. Because the scheme had fixed a rate by reference to the year the installation had become eligible, reduction of that rate (apart from fluctuations in the RPI) would have had a retrospective effect. Therefore, such legislation would only have been valid if the empowering provision contained in section 41 of the 2008 act had authorised such an effect. However, on a proper construction, section 41 of the 2008 act contained no power to introduce a modification which reduced a fixed rate by reference to an installation becoming eligible before the modification.

The petitioners emphasized that Scottish National Heritage (SNH) had recommended against approval of the wind farm because of its adverse impacts, and that the Town & Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997 requires the Ministers to consult with SNH and others. However, the Highland Council, the local planning authority, had concluded that the wind farm would have minimal impacts on view sheds. The court rejected the petitioners' arguments. It explained that the Ministers were not required to agree with the recommendations they received from consulting bodies, but only to explain their decision in full and to respond to points raised by consulting bodies if necessary. Because the Ministers' explanation reflected a balancing of the relevant factors and met the ""clear and cogent"" standard in the court's view, it would stand."

It is not possible to appeal this decision.|","Plan B Earth, a charity with the mission to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, has filed a climate change lawsuit against the Secretary of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (Secretary of State). Plan B Earth is joined in the lawsuit by 11 citizen claimants ranging in age from 9 to 79 who are impacted by climate change in a variety of ways. The claimants allege that the Secretary of State violated the Climate Change Act 2008 (the 2008 Act) and other law by failing to revise a 2050 carbon reduction target in light of new international law and scientific developments.<br><br>On December 8, 2017, the claimants filed a claim form and a document listing their grounds for judicial review at the High Court of Justice Administrative Court. They note that the 2008 Act set a carbon emissions reduction target for the year 2050 that is at least 80% lower than the aggregate total of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 (the 2050 target). This 2050 target was consistent with limiting average warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. The claimants argue that the Secretary of State should make the 2050 target more ambitious to reflect scientific developments since 2008 and the Paris Agreement's intention to limit average warming to 1.5 degrees C. Under Section 2 of the 2008 Act, the Secretary of State has the authority to revise the target in light of scientific developments and international law.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Claimants present five grounds for seeking judicial review of the Secretary of State's failure to revise the 2050 target: (1) it is ultra vires, because it frustrates the legislative purpose of the 2008 Act; (2) it is based on an error of law regarding the objective of the Paris Agreement; (3) it is irrational, because it fails to take into account and / or inappropriately weighs considerations including the risks of global climate change and predictions of future technical innovation; (4) it violates the Human Rights Act 1998; and (5) it breaches the public sector equality duty set out in Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010.&nbsp;<br><br>Claimants seek declaratory relief that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in violation of his responsibilities under the 2008 Act and a ""mandatory order that the Secretary of State revise the 2050 target in accordance with the purpose of the 2008 Act and the UK's international law obligations, ensuring, at a minimum, that the 2050 target commits the UK to an equitable contribution the Paris Agreement objective and that it conforms to the precautionary principle."" They also seek what other relief the court deems appropriate and costs.&nbsp;<br><br>In February, 2018, the claimants' application for judicial review was denied on all five grounds. The claimants renewed their application for review. On March 20, 2018, a permission hearing took place at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand to determine if the case was strong enough to merit a full hearing. The hearing was adjourned after the Justice decided that the complexity of the issues would require a full-day permission hearing. The Justice also requested a more detailed statement from the Committee on Climate Change, an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008. The Committee is an interested party in the litigation.&nbsp;<br><br>On July 20, 2018, the High Court found the claims were not arguable and denied permission for the case to proceed. Plan B Earth appealed the decision on multiple grounds, including alleging that the judge misinterpreted Article 2(1)(a)of the Paris Agreement. Appellants argue that the judge incorrectly read this provision to allow for a range of ambition rather than holding the UK for responsible for ""[h]olding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels."" Accordingly, appellants further argue that the judge incorrectly found the current UK 2050 climate target compatible with the Paris Agreement due to this misinterpretation of required ambition.&nbsp;<br><br>On January 25, 2019, the Court of Appeal rejected Plan B's appeal of the High Court's denial to hear the case, marking the end of the appeal process. The court concluded that none of the 7 stated grounds had a real prospect of success. The court did not find an error in law in regard to an alleged failure to exercise discretion to amend the 2050 target, nor did the court find that the Secretary of State misunderstood the Paris Agreement or the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. While acknowledging that a governmental response to the need for environmental protection engages human rights in general, the court declined to find that relevant given its other findings that officials exercised proper discretion and understanding of the Paris Agreement and climate-related advice."

(Additional claimants participated in the suit, but these two groups took lead on the climate-related claims.) Claimants argued that the Secretary's national policy statement supporting the expansion of Heathrow Airport violated the Planning Act 2008 (""the 2008 Act"") and the Human Rights Act 1998. The case went before the High Court of Justice Queen's Bench Division Administrative Court which refused all six climate change-related claims filed by the two environmental organisations.&nbsp;<br><br>Environmental Claimants argued that since the 2008 Act requires the Secretary to pursue the objective of sustainable development and consider the desirability of mitigating and adapting to climate change, it further gives rise to implicit obligations to consider the advice of the Committee on Climate Change (""the CCC""), the government's obligations under the Paris Agreement and commitment to review its national climate change targets in light of the Paris Agreement. Claimants maintained that the Secretary violated these implicit obligations by supporting the airport expansion without adequate consideration of the insufficiency of the current UK 2050 climate target (""2050 Target""), the UK's commitments under the Paris Agreement, the CCC's recommendations to review the 2050 Target, and government's recent agreement to review the 2050 Target. Accordingly, they asserted the Secretary's actions were both ultra vires and irrational. Plaintiffs additionally alleged violations of the Human Rights Act 1998. Claimants sought declaratory relief, specifically a declaration that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in violation of section 5 of the 2008 Act.&nbsp;<br><br>The court did not find that the Secretary had any obligations to consider the Paris Agreement climate targets, the science underlying those climate targets, or a more stringent potential future climate target necessary for meeting the Paris Agreement. The court was not persuaded by arguments that the 2008 Act's climate action goals could be interpreted to make obligations under the Human Rights Act of 1998 inclusive of the Paris Agreement goals. The court found that the Secretary had fulfilled his obligations to consider existing domestic climate targets and acted within his discretion.&nbsp;<br><br>The Court of Appeal has granted plaintiffs the permission to appeal the lower court decision. The judge wrote that the ""[i]mportance of the issues raised in these and the related proceedings is obvious."" At the appeal hearing, which took place on October 21, 2019, Friends of the Earth reiterated their arguments that 1) the government was in breach of the sustainable development duty under section 10(3) of the Planning Act for not considering the Paris Agreement, the non-CO2 impacts and the long term impacts of the Airport National Policy Statement beyond 2050, and 2) the SoS acted unlawfully by omitting reference to international environmental protection objectives in the Appraisal of Sustainability as required by sch.2 of SEA regulations.<br><br>On February 27, 2020 the Court of Appeal reversed the lower court. The court concluded that the Government had made a commitment to the Paris Agreement goals a part of ""Government policy"" by the time the ANPS was prepared. The Secretary, as a result, needed to expressly consider and address the Paris Agreement goals during the ANPS process (but did not need to act in accordance with the Paris Agreement or reach any particular outcome). The court held that by failing to consider the Paris Agreement the Secretary violated the Planning Act and the requirement to undertake a strategic environmental assessment pursuant to EC Council Directive 2001/42/EC. The court therefore concluded that the ANPS is invalid and must be redone. The court further ruled that in completing a new ANPS, the Secretary should consider the non-carbon dioxide climate impacts of aviation and the effects of emissions beyond 2050, both of which had been omitted from the original analysis. The court did not find it necessary to quash the ANPS, but rather determined that the appropriate form of relief was a declaration that the decision to approve a new runway was unlawful and the ANPS may not have legal effect unless and until the Secretary undertakes a review of it in accordance with the Planning Act.<br><br>On May 6, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal. The UK Supreme Court overturned an appellate court decision, allowing the approval process for a third runway at Heathrow International Airport to move forward, on the grounds that the government sufficiently took into account climate impacts with regard to previous, less stringent, climate goals. The appellate court previously ruled that the government acted unlawfully by approving the expansion without considering the country's commitment to meeting the Paris Agreement goals."

Banks &amp; Co. Ltd challenged the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities, and Local Government under section 288 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 for denying a planning permission for a coal mining project. The High Court quashed the denial on two grounds, including the Secretary's inadequate explanation of how preventing the project would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Northumberland County Council granted planning permission to H. J. Banks &amp; Co. Ltd for a surface mine for the extraction of coal, sandstone, and fireclay in the Highthorn area of southeast Northumberland. The Secretary called the application in for his own determination and after a public inquiry declined to grant permission for the project, giving considerable weight in his decision-making to the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions. H. J. Banks &amp; Co. Ltd challenged the denial on two grounds. The first ground alleged an error in the Secretary's interpretation of balancing considerations under paragraph 149 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The second ground alleged that the Secretary wrongly weighed greenhouse gas emissions resulting from burning coal at power plants and that the Secretary acted inconsistently with previous practice in how the Secretary considered these emissions. The High Court quashed the decision on grounds one and two. On ground one, the High Court determined that the Secretary had not lawfully weighed the relative costs and benefits of tourism and biodiversity as required under the balancing test of paragraph 149 of the NPPF and related regulations. On ground two, the High Court found that the Secretary provided insufficient reasoning to explain why emissions would be reduced if the coal project was denied because there was not adequate explanation of how power generation would be replaced by less carbon-intensive sources rather than imported coal. The Court found that the Secretary provided inadequate reasoning for how national policy to decarbonize was inconsistent with granting the permission."

The Administrative Court of the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court of Justice quashed paragraph 209(a). Paragraph 209(a) instructed minerals planning authorities to recognize the benefits of developing oil and gas, including unconventional hydrocarbons, and to implement policies to facilitate their exploration and extraction. The court concluded that the Secretary of State for Housing and Communities and Local Government acted unlawfully by failing to undertake a proper public consultation or to account for recent evidence of the climate impacts of shale gas development. The claimant also argued that paragraph 209(a) triggered the need to conduct a Strategic Environmental Assessment and ran afoul of the UK's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Climate Change Act of 2008, claims that the court rejected.

In 2017, the Preston New Road Action Group and an individual named Gayzer Frackman both appealed the dismissal on different grounds; Frackman's appeal raised several climate-related issues.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>Frackman claimed, among other things, that the Secretary of State failed to follow Directive 2011/92/EU, which requires that an environmental impact assessment analyze indirect, secondary, and cumulative effects. Frackman argued that the Secretary had improperly failed to require an assessment of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions arising from the extended flow testing phase of the proposed project. The court disagreed, concluding that greenhouse gas emissions associated with exploration were fully assessed. Frackman also challenged the omission of any analysis of the indirect impacts of the succeeding production stage if the exploration proved the existence of a viable shale gas play. The court rejected this claim, reasoning that any possible future proposal would have to be considered on its own panning merits in light of a new environmental assessment. Finally, Frackman asserted that the Secretary was inconsistent in considering the potential benefits of natural gas in meeting the UK's planning goal of transitioning to a low-carbon future without assessing potential harms. The court dismissed this argument, concluding that the Secretary properly determined that shale gas exploration would help to achieve the objective of reducing carbon by establishing whether commercially viable natural gas existed on the sites in question.<br><br></div><div>The court dismissed both appeals in their entirety."

Pursuant to the EU ETS, Repsol received a free allocation of allowances for the period 2012-2017 based on a historic baseline assessment of CO2 emissions from Bleo Holm, and was required to surrender sufficient allowances to cover its total emissions each year, whether the free allowances or additional allowances that had been purchased. Following an investigation, the Offshore Production Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) found that there had been a significant decrease in capacity at Bleo Holm and, as a result, determined that Repsol was not entitled to all of the free allowances that it had received. OPRED sought to recover the over-allocated allowances under the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2012 on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). OPRED is still investigating another significant capacity reduction issue which may have resulted in an over-allocation of allowances to Repsol.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>While the issues related to Repsol's allowances for 2013-2017 were under review, in December 2018, the European Commission decided to suspend the allocation of free allowances to UK operators in light of the uncertainties surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union. As a result, Repsol did not receive free allowances in 2018 as expected, and so the company had to purchase sufficient allowances to offset its emissions for that year.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>In March 2019 Repsol appealed BEIS's Notice of Recovery, bringing three claims before the Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber. First, Repsol contended that BEIS should not have sought to recover the total number of allowances that had been over-allocated for 2012-2017, but rather, should have netted off the allowances that Repsol did not receive in 2018 due to the European Commission's decision to suspend the allocation of free allowances to UK operators. Second, Repsol argued that the European Commission's decision to withhold allowances from UK operators was unlawful. Third, Repsol claimed that by seeking recovery of allowances without netting off the allowances to which Repsol was entitled, BEIS violated Repsol's property rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights. Repsol asked the Tribunal to quash the Notice of Recovery.<br><br></div><div>On November 18, 2019, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal. According to the Tribunal's order, the parties agree there was an over-allocation of allowances as a result of Repsol's failure to notify BEIS of the decreased capacity at Bleo Holm, and so BEIS had the power to issue a Notice of Recovery. The Tribunal further explained that although a Notice of Recovery must provide certain information to an operator, this does not include the details of any calculation to determine the sum of allowances to which the operator is entitled. Therefore, the Tribunal reasoned, the sum of allowances does not include any netting-off calculation. Moreover, the 2012 regulations are intended to implement a strict accounting system. Given this, the Tribunal determined that BEIS did not err in declining to net off any allowances from the Notice of Recovery. The Tribunal further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to re-interpret the European Commission's decision to suspend allowance allocations to UK operators or to declare the decision unlawful. Finally, the Tribunal held that it lacked the power to resolve Repsol's property rights claim."

Their claim was defended by the Oil and Gas Authority (“OGA”) and the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (“SoS”; Kwasi Kwarteng). The strategy was laid before Parliament in December 2020, came into force in February 2021, and gives the OGA a dual mandate to both “secure that the maximum value of economically recoverable petroleum is recovered from the strata beneath relevant UK waters” and, in doing so, “to take appropriate steps to assist the Secretary of State in meeting the net zero target.” The strategy sets out plans to support ongoing efforts to exploit North Sea oil and gas reserves. Under the Petroleum Act 1998, the Strategy needs to ensure the maximization of the “economic recovery of UK petroleum.""&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>On January 18, 2022 the High Court gave judgment, rejecting the Claimants’ two grounds of challenge and dismissing their claim.&nbsp;<br><br>The first of the two grounds alleged error of law and/or frustration of statutory purpose. The Claimants argued that by ignoring the effect of government-backed financial support, the Strategy has stretched the definition of ""economically recoverable"" too wide, such that activities that are not truly ""economic"" for the UK are nonetheless still sought to be maximized through the Strategy. According to the claimants, this endangers the UK’s ability to meet Net Zero, as required under the Climate Change Act 2008. The main issue was therefore whether the OGA's definition of ""economically recoverable"" in its Strategy was consistent with the statutory term ""maximizing the economic recovery of UK petroleum” or whether it frustrates the statutory purpose.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The High Court began its consideration of this ground by considering the court’s role, concluding that the court will afford ‘considerable deference’ to the OGA’s expert view as regulator, and that Parliament, when enacting the legislation, did not intend for the court (rather than the expert regulator) to determine the best method of economic assessment. In any event the High Court agreed with the OGA’s interpretation of the legislative provisions. (Judgment, paragraphs 55 to 114.)<br><br></div><div>The second ground alleged the OGA’s approach was irrational given the UK Government’s net zero target under the Climate Change Act 2008 and statements made by the OGA in relation to that target. The High Court rejected the Claimants’ arguments. The OGA’s approach to the legislation was permissible, as per the Court’s findings under ground one. The question of how to balance various objectives is a matter for the regulator, not the court. The OGA, in consulting on and adopting the Strategy, ‘manifestly had considerable regard to UK domestic action on climate change’. The Claimants’ arguments had ‘no basis in the statute’ and ‘[contradicted] the whole concept of maximizing economic recovery’.

On September 27, 2019, SCC granted planning permission to Horse Hill Developments Limited (the “Developer”) for the retention and extension of a well site and the drilling of four new wells for the production of hydrocarbons (crude oil) over a 25 year period (20 years operational).&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The environmental statement issued by the Developer under the EIA Regulations provided an assessment of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of the oil itself (scope 1 and 2 emissions). It did not assess the emissions that would subsequently be produced as a result of using the oil (scope 3 emissions) i.e. from the combustion of the oil. The Claimant, Sarah Finch, argued that SCC’s failure to consider these emissions in determining whether to approve the project was a breach of the EIA Regulations. The Claimant contended that either SCC had misinterpreted relevant national regulations in determining that the end-use emissions should be excluded from the assessment, or that the relevant regulations were unlawful because they were in conflict with the EIA Directive. They also argued that the end-use emissions from the project should have been considered in relation to the UK’s net zero target.<br><br></div><div>On July 15, 2020, the case was granted permission to proceed and the judge identified a further issue relating to whether national planning policy was in conformity with EU law.

The trial took place in the High Court on 17-18 November 2020. The case was defended by SCC, along with two interested parties: the Developer and the SoS. The environmental NGO Friends of the Earth (FoE) obtained permission to intervene, and supported the Claimant’s case.<br><br></div><div>On December 21, 2020, the judgment was handed down. The case was dismissed by the High Court on the basis that “the assessment of GHG emissions from the future combustion of refined oil products...was, as a matter of law, incapable of falling within the scope to the EIA required by the 2017 Regulations for the planning application.” Permission to appeal was subsequently granted on the basis that there were compelling reasons for the case to be heard.&nbsp;<br><br></div><div>The appeal hearing took place on 16-17 November 2021. The Appellant (Ms Finch) argued that the scope 3 emissions were “likely significant effects of the development” which should have been taken into account as part of the EIA, under regulations 4 and 18 and Paragraph 5 Schedule 4 of the EIA Regulations. In addition, the Appellant argued that the reasons given by SCC for not requiring that assessment were inadequate (and so unlawful), because it had not evidenced what separate pollution control regimes existed, and how they would operate, to regulate those downstream emissions and absolve it of the requirement to take them into account. FoE again intervened in the appeal and supported the Claimant’s challenge. FoE referred to case law from other jurisdictions in which EIA does include the assessment of scope 3 emissions in the context of fossil fuel projects. The appeal was defended by SCC, the Developer and the SoS.<br><br></div><div>The Court of Appeal’s decision was handed down on the February 17, 2022. The decision was split 2:1. The majority ruling was that SCC’s decision to grant planning permission without the EIA considering the end-use GHG emissions was lawful. The decision-maker had a discretion on whether or not to include these impacts in the EIA. The dissenting judge, Lord Justice Moylan, concluded that the Council’s decision was unlawful.<br><br>"

On his appeal against conviction, Mr Brown agued the court below should have stayed the prosecution for the common law offense of public nuisance (which has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment) as an abuse of process. This was because alternative statutory offenses were available, such as aggravated trespass (which has a maximum penalty of three months). Failure to stay, argued Mr Brown, amounted to a breach of his human rights (freedom of thought, conscience and religion; freedom of expression; and freedom of assembly and association). Rejecting these arguments, the Court held that the concept of abuse of process in a criminal case is the creature of domestic law and does not turn on any issue under the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998. On his appeal against sentence, Mr Brown argued the 12 months imprisonment was too long given the offense was committed in the course of protest. Instead, only a fine should have been imposed. The Court considered jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights on when a custodial sentence might be appropriate in the context of peaceful protest amounting to public nuisance. It agreed with the court below that Mr Brown’s offending passed the custody threshold. However, taking account his conduct (including that this was a peaceful protest), his previous convictions and his disability it held the 12 month sentence was manifestly excessive, and substituted a four-month sentence.<br><br>"

This mean that he was not able to properly understand the risk to the delivery of the policies in the NZS. Risk to delivery was an obviously material consideration.<br>2. The NZS itself lacked vital information which meant that Parliament and the public were unable to properly scrutinize it (breach of s.14 of the CCA). For example, Parliament was not aware of the 5% shortfall for meeting CB6. The NZS should have included quantified policies (i.e. setting out what their individual emissions reductions were estimated to be), in order for Parliament to be able to scrutinize risk to delivery.

That means: (i) aligning emissions reductions to the 1.5˚C Paris objective; (ii) preparing for the impacts of climate change, so far as that is possible (including by providing the public with good information); (iii) aligning public and private finance flows to the 1.5˚C Paris objective; and (iv) making the polluter pay, with effective mechanisms to ensure compensation and reparation for the victims of climate change.<br><br></div><div>This case is related to a previous <a href=""https://climate-laws.org/geographies/united-kingdom/litigation_cases/plan-b-earth-and-others-v-prime-minister"">claim </a>filed before the High Court of the United Kingdom in March 2021, which was refused permission to proceed on the papers but was later appealed by the claimants. Nevertheless, in March 2022, the UK Court of Appeal refused to hear the Claimant’s case on the basis that the Paris Agreement was irrelevant: “The fundamental difficulty which the Claimants face is that there is no authority from the European Court of Human Rights on which they can rely, citing the Paris Agreement as being relevant to the interpretation of the ECHR, Articles 2 and 8 [the rights to life and to family life]”. It also ruled that the fact that the family life of the three young people bringing the claim is inextricably linked to communities on the frontline of the crisis in the Global South was irrelevant to determining the scope of their right to family life, despite the prohibition against discrimination in safeguarding Convention rights.<br><br>"

The application alleges that the UK Government is in breach of their obligations under Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the Convention for failing to address the risks of the climate crisis, future pandemics and antibiotic resistance created by factory farming. This application poses novel climate arguments focusing on the danger of agricultural methane emissions, and highlighting soy feed consumption in UK factory farming as a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon basin. The application also cites for the first time before the ECHR the ruling of the Brazilian Supreme Court in PSB et al v Brazil (on Climate Fund), which recognized the Paris Agreement as a human rights treaty. Given the urgency of the case and other pending climate cases before the ECHR, an application has been made for the case to be assessed on a priority basis.<br><br>Full case documents will be added as they become available."

They displayed a banner saying ‘For Health’s Sake. Stop Financing Fossil Fuels’, to highlight the estimated £10 billion in annual financial support the UK government gives to the fossil fuel industry. The group were present at an earlier blockade by Extinction Rebellion, which had taken place from 2pm to 4:30pm. Most protesters left by 4.30pm but the health professionals elected to block the bridge to make their own protest. Thirty minutes later, shortly after 5pm, they were arrested.<br>Seven of the arrested protesters were subsequently charged with breach of section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986. That section allows police officers to place conditions on public assemblies. It is then a criminal offence to take part in a public assembly whilst knowingly failing to comply with such conditions. (Section 14 has, controversially, since been expanded by the UK government to allow noisy protest to be criminalised, but those amendments were not in force at the time of the protest on Lambeth Bridge.)<br>The Magistrates Court acquitted all defendants. Judge Robinson, who presided over the case, was not convinced that the necessary steps that are required for the imposition of section 14 had been taken. The Judge remarked on acquittal “I was impressed by the integrity and rationality of their beliefs” and “their evidence was highly moving.”<br><br></div><div><br><br>"
