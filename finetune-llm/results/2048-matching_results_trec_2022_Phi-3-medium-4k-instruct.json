GnRH travels through the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates the gland to produce hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones stimulate the testicles or ovaries. The testicles produce testosterone and develop sperm. The ovaries produce estrogen and prepare for ovulation. Normal estrogen and testosterone levels are required for puberty. Some people, however, have either low levels or total lack of GnRH. This can cause problems with puberty and fertility. Researchers want to study people with low or no GnRH to better understand how it affects puberty and fertility.~Objectives:~- To study disorders of GnRH production.~Eligibility:~Adult men and women at least 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.~Adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.~Participants will have tests to look at their hormone levels. Blood samples may be collected after taking different drugs, including insulin and cortisone. A 24-hour urine sample will be collected.~Participants will have imaging studies to look at bone and brain development. They will also have ultrasounds of the kidneys, abdomen, and reproductive organs.~Tests of smell and hearing will be used to look for abnormalities in these senses.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0. Since hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is a rare condition, with an incidence of 1/10,000 to 1/86,000 for isolated GnRH deficiency (43, 44), this protocol remains open to enrollment so that we may study all subjects that are both qualified and interested in participating. Males or females who are >= 14 years old with clinical findings of HH as follows will be included (due to substantial variability among patient presentations, this will be based on the clinical judgement of the investigator):\n1. Failure to go through a normal, age-appropriate, spontaneous puberty and low sex steroid levels in the setting of low/normal gonadotropins; OR\n2. Normal puberty with subsequent development of low gonadotropin levels.\n3. A patient under the age of 14 years may be considered for baseline evaluation if there is sufficient evidence suggestive of HH, including, but not limited to any two of the following: anosmia, history of cryptorchidism or microphallus. As above, due to substantial variability among patient presentations, this will be based on the clinical judgement of the Investigator.\n\n\n\nPlain JSON output:",

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.\nThe factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\nYou should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:\n\tElement 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.\n\tElement 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.\n\tElement 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {\"not applicable\", \"not enough information\", \"excluded\", \"not excluded\"}. \"not applicable\" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. \"not enough information\" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less \"not enough information\" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. \"excluded\" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while \"not excluded\" means the reverse.\nYou should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.",

On physical examination, there is some pubic hair and poorly developed secondary sexual characteristics.\n4. He is unable to detect coffee smell during the examination, but the visual acuity is normal.\n5. Ultrasound reveals the testes volume of 1-2 ml.\n6.

GnRH travels through the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates the gland to produce hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones stimulate the testicles or ovaries. The testicles produce testosterone and develop sperm. The ovaries produce estrogen and prepare for ovulation. Normal estrogen and testosterone levels are required for puberty. Some people, however, have either low levels or total lack of GnRH. This can cause problems with puberty and fertility. Researchers want to study people with low or no GnRH to better understand how it affects puberty and fertility.~Objectives:~- To study disorders of GnRH production.~Eligibility:~Adult men and women at least 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.~Adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.~Participants will have tests to look at their hormone levels. Blood samples may be collected after taking different drugs, including insulin and cortisone.
