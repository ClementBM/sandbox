Many thyroid cancers absorb iodine. Due to this, doctors often give radioactive iodine (iodine I-131) alone to treat thyroid cancer as part of standard practice. It is thought that the more thyroid tumors are able to absorb radioactive iodine, the more likely it is that the radioactive iodine will cause those tumors to shrink. Selumetinib may help radioactive iodine work better in patients whose tumors still absorb radioactive iodine. It is not yet known whether iodine I-131 is more effective with or without selumetinib in treating thyroid cancer.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0. Diagnosis of recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer\n1. Histological or cytological confirmation of thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin (including papillary, follicular, or poorly differentiated subtypes and their respective variants); NOTE: medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers are excluded; Hurthle cell carcinomas are excluded (defined as having an invasive tumor composed of > 75% oncocytic [Hurthle] cells lacking the nuclear features of papillary carcinoma, tumor necrosis, and marked mitotic activity); patients with oncocytic (Hurthle cell) variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma (defined as a tumor composed of a majority of oncocytic [Hurthle] cells having the nuclear features of papillary carcinoma) are eligible to participate\n2. RAI-avid lesion on a radioiodine scan (a diagnostic, post-therapy, or post-ablation scans) performed =< 24 months prior to registration, which suggests that therapy with 131I is justifiable in the judgment of the investigator\n3. Clinically or radiographically evident structural disease; patients with measurable disease and those with only non-measurable (non-target) structural disease (according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version [v] 1.1 criteria) are eligible;\n4. NOTE 1: Modification of the RECIST v1.1 measurable disease criteria includes a change in the definition of what is considered a measurable malignant lymph node; a malignant lymph node is considered measurable if any of the following apply:\n5. It is noted to be RAI-avid on radioactive iodine imaging (diagnostic or post-therapy whole body scans acceptable) and it measures >= 1 cm in the long axis,\n6. It is pathologically proven to be involved with thyroid cancer (by cytology or pathology) and it measures >= 1 cm in the long axis, or\n7. Its short axis is >= 1.5 cm when assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan NOTE 2: Patients only with biochemical evidence of disease without structural evidence of cancer are not eligible for this study\n8.

Many thyroid cancers absorb iodine. Due to this, doctors often give radioactive iodine (iodine I-131) alone to treat thyroid cancer as part of standard practice. It is thought that the more thyroid tumors are able to absorb radioactive iodine, the more likely it is that the radioactive iodine will cause those tumors to shrink. Selumetinib may help radioactive iodine work better in patients whose tumors still absorb radioactive iodine. It is not yet known whether iodine I-131 is more effective with or without selumetinib in treating thyroid cancer.\nExclusion criteria:\n 0. 131I therapy =< 6 months prior to registration; Note: 131I administered solely for diagnostic purposes is not considered 131I therapy\n1.

Human papilloma virus, or HPV, is a common infection of the genitalia in women that usually goes away by itself. If HPV infection does not go away, it might turn into cancer of the cervix, although this is rare. This study will examine why many HPV infections go away and why a few persist and lead to cervical cancer.~Women 18 years of age and older who are referred for colposcopy (examination of the vagina and cervix using an instrument with a magnifying lens) at the University of Oklahoma following Pap smear diagnosis may be eligible for this study. Women will be in one of the following diagnostic categories:~Cancer: Stage 1-2 only.~Precancer: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3).~HPV-infected: Positive for any of the 13 known cancer-causing HPV types, but not diagnosed with cancer or CIN3.~Normal: Negative for cancer-causing HPV and normal tissue laboratory results.~Participants will undergo the following procedures:~Questionnaire: Covers demographic information (such as age, race, ethnicity, marital status, etc.), pregnancy history, menstrual and sexual history, contraceptive history, hormone medication history, medical history, smoking history, physical development, family history, and health care access.~Blood test: 2 tablespoons of blood drawn.~Colposcopy.~Procedure to collect a sample of cervical cells and fluids for HPV testing and research.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0. All women who are referred for cervical colposcopy to the University of Oklahoma will be considered eligible for the study. These women will be categorized into four groups: (i) cancer, (ii) precancer, (iii) HPV-infected, and (iv) normal. Cancers will be limited to women diagnosed with early cancer (Stage 1-2) to minimize potential disease effects. Precancers will be defined as women diagnosed histologically with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN3). This is a highly specific and well-reproduced diagnosis which effectively represents carcinoma in situ. All women testing DNA positive for any of the 13 known oncogenic HPV types (HPV-infected), but not diagnosed with CIN3 or cancer (all stages) will be placed in the HPV-positive group. This group will therefore encompass all HPV-infected women diagnosed with either cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 1 (CIN1), CIN2, low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS), atypical glandular cells of underdetermined significance (AGUS), or found cytologically normal. Women referred to the colposcopy clinic but found to be negative for oncogenic HPV and normal upon histological diagnoses will be eligible as normal controls; this approach will be an ethical method for collecting biopsies from essentially normal women as there are many benign look alike conditions that are ruled out in colposcopy clinics. While this group may not be a random sample of the general population, the use of specimens from these women as controls will ensure a group of women who are truly confirmed as having no neoplasia.\n\n\n\nPlain JSON output:",

Human papilloma virus, or HPV, is a common infection of the genitalia in women that usually goes away by itself. If HPV infection does not go away, it might turn into cancer of the cervix, although this is rare. This study will examine why many HPV infections go away and why a few persist and lead to cervical cancer.~Women 18 years of age and older who are referred for colposcopy (examination of the vagina and cervix using an instrument with a magnifying lens) at the University of Oklahoma following Pap smear diagnosis may be eligible for this study. Women will be in one of the following diagnostic categories:~Cancer: Stage 1-2 only.~Precancer: Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN3).~HPV-infected: Positive for any of the 13 known cancer-causing HPV types, but not diagnosed with cancer or CIN3.~Normal: Negative for cancer-causing HPV and normal tissue laboratory results.~Participants will undergo the following procedures:~Questionnaire: Covers demographic information (such as age, race, ethnicity, marital status, etc.), pregnancy history, menstrual and sexual history, contraceptive history, hormone medication history, medical history, smoking history, physical development, family history, and health care access.~Blood test: 2 tablespoons of blood drawn.~Colposcopy.~Procedure to collect a sample of cervical cells and fluids for HPV testing and research.\nExclusion criteria:\n 0. Women attending the clinic solely for vaginal colposcopies will be excluded from the study. Women who are under 18 years of age or pregnant at the visit will also be excluded from the study. In addition, women who have had prior treatment (women coming to the clinic for a follow-up visit subsequent to treatment (women coming to the clinic for a follow-up visit subsequent to treatment or women coming for their initial clinic visit following pretreatment with chemotherapy or radiation) will be excluded. All women with known HIV or AIDS will be excluded from the study. This information will not be readily available unless the woman has previously been seen at the University of Oklahoma clinic. This event is considered rare; recent studies of HIV and AIDS by the University of Oklahoma from the same population have been terminated due to the lack of HIV/AIDS detected in the population.\n\n\n\nPlain JSON output:",

                "exclusion_system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant for clinical trial recruitment. Your task is to compare a given patient note and the exclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.\nThe factors that disqualify someone from participating are called exclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\nYou should check the exclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:\n\tElement 1. For each exclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.\n\tElement 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.\n\tElement 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific exclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {\"not applicable\", \"not enough information\", \"excluded\", \"not excluded\"}. \"not applicable\" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. \"not enough information\" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less \"not enough information\" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. \"excluded\" denotes that the patient meets the exclusion criterion and should be excluded in the trial, while \"not excluded\" means the reverse.\nYou should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.",
