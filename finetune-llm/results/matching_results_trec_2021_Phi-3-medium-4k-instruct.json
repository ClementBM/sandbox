Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.\nThe factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria. They are based on characteristics such as age, gender, the type and stage of a disease, previous treatment history, and other medical conditions.\nYou should check the inclusion criteria one-by-one, and output the following three elements for each criterion:\n\tElement 1. For each inclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.\n\tElement 2. If there is relevant information, you must generate a list of relevant sentence IDs in the patient note. If there is no relevant information, you must annotate an empty list.\n\tElement 3. Classify the patient eligibility for this specific inclusion criterion: the label must be chosen from {\"not applicable\", \"not enough information\", \"included\", \"not included\"}. \"not applicable\" should only be used for criteria that are not applicable to the patient. \"not enough information\" should be used where the patient note does not contain sufficient information for making the classification. Try to use as less \"not enough information\" as possible because if the note does not mention a medically important fact, you can assume that the fact is not true for the patient. \"included\" denotes that the patient meets the inclusion criterion, while \"not included\" means the reverse.\nYou should output only a JSON dict exactly formatted as: dict{str(criterion_number): list[str(element_1_brief_reasoning), list[int(element_2_sentence_id)], str(element_3_eligibility_label)]}.",

The patient will provide informed consent, and will comply with the trial protocol without any practical issues.\n\nHere is the clinical trial:\nTitle: Iodine I-131 With or Without Selumetinib in Treating Patients With Recurrent or Metastatic Thyroid Cancer\nTarget diseases: Metastatic Thyroid Gland Carcinoma, Poorly Differentiated Thyroid Gland Carcinoma, Recurrent Thyroid Gland Carcinoma, Stage IV Thyroid Gland Follicular Carcinoma AJCC v7, Stage IV Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma AJCC v7, Stage IVA Thyroid Gland Follicular Carcinoma AJCC v7, Stage IVA Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma AJCC v7, Stage IVB Thyroid Gland Follicular Carcinoma AJCC v7, Stage IVB Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma AJCC v7, Stage IVC Thyroid Gland Follicular Carcinoma AJCC v7, Stage IVC Thyroid Gland Papillary Carcinoma AJCC v7\nInterventions: Iodine I-131, Placebo Administration, Selumetinib\nSummary: This phase II trial studies how well iodine I-131 works with or without selumetinib in treating patients with thyroid cancer that has returned (recurrent) or has spread from where it started to other places in the body (metastatic). Many thyroid cancers absorb iodine. Due to this, doctors often give radioactive iodine (iodine I-131) alone to treat thyroid cancer as part of standard practice. It is thought that the more thyroid tumors are able to absorb radioactive iodine, the more likely it is that the radioactive iodine will cause those tumors to shrink. Selumetinib may help radioactive iodine work better in patients whose tumors still absorb radioactive iodine. It is not yet known whether iodine I-131 is more effective with or without selumetinib in treating thyroid cancer.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0. Diagnosis of recurrent and/or metastatic thyroid cancer\n1. Histological or cytological confirmation of thyroid carcinoma of follicular origin (including papillary, follicular, or poorly differentiated subtypes and their respective variants); NOTE: medullary and anaplastic thyroid cancers are excluded; Hurthle cell carcinomas are excluded (defined as having an invasive tumor composed of > 75% oncocytic [Hurthle] cells lacking the nuclear features of papillary carcinoma, tumor necrosis, and marked mitotic activity); patients with oncocytic (Hurthle cell) variants of papillary thyroid carcinoma (defined as a tumor composed of a majority of oncocytic [Hurthle] cells having the nuclear features of papillary carcinoma) are eligible to participate\n2. RAI-avid lesion on a radioiodine scan (a diagnostic, post-therapy, or post-ablation scans) performed =< 24 months prior to registration, which suggests that therapy with 131I is justifiable in the judgment of the investigator\n3. Clinically or radiographically evident structural disease; patients with measurable disease and those with only non-measurable (non-target) structural disease (according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] version [v] 1.1 criteria) are eligible;\n4. NOTE 1: Modification of the RECIST v1.1 measurable disease criteria includes a change in the definition of what is considered a measurable malignant lymph node; a malignant lymph node is considered measurable if any of the following apply:\n5. It is noted to be RAI-avid on radioactive iodine imaging (diagnostic or post-therapy whole body scans acceptable) and it measures >= 1 cm in the long axis,\n6. It is pathologically proven to be involved with thyroid cancer (by cytology or pathology) and it measures >= 1 cm in the long axis, or\n7. Its short axis is >= 1.5 cm when assessed by computed tomography (CT) scan NOTE 2: Patients only with biochemical evidence of disease without structural evidence of cancer are not eligible for this study\n8. For patients with non-measurable, structural disease the following must apply:\n9. Undetectable thyroglobulin antibody AND\n10. A serum thyroglobulin of 10 ng/ml or greater in the context of suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) (TSH =< 0.4 mcU/ml) =< 28 days prior to study registration; use of any thyroglobulin assay is allowed, though all serum thyroglobulin measurements for study purposes must be conducted with the same thyroglobulin assay\n11. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 0, 1 or 2\n12. Able to swallow and retain orally-administered medication with no clinically significant gastrointestinal abnormalities that may alter absorption\n13. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) >= 1500/mm^3 (obtained =< 28 days prior to randomization)\n14. Platelet count >= 100,000/mm^3 (obtained =< 28 days prior to randomization)\n15. Hemoglobin > 9.0 g/dL (obtained =< 28 days prior to randomization)\n16. Total bilirubin =< 1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN) (obtained =< 28 days prior to randomization)\n17. Aspartate transaminase (AST) =< 2.5 x ULN (or =< 5 x ULN in presence of liver metastases) (obtained =< 28 days prior to randomization)\n18. Creatinine =< 1.5 mg/dL OR calculated creatinine clearance of >= 50 ml/min by either the Cockcroft-Gault formula or 24-hours urine collection analysis (obtained =< 28 days prior to randomization)\n19. Negative pregnancy test performed =< 7 days prior to registration for women of childbearing potential only\n20. Provide informed written consent\n21. Willing to return to enrolling institution for follow-up (during the Active Monitoring Phase of the study)\n22. Note: during the Active Monitoring Phase of a study (i.e., active treatment and observation), participants must be willing to return to the consenting institution for follow-up\n23. Willing to provide mandatory archival tumor tissue (block or minimum of 30 unstained slides from a primary or recurrent/metastatic thyroid cancer) for correlative research purposes; NOTE: patients with less archival tumor tissue available may still be eligible for the study after discussion with Academic and Community Cancer Research United (ACCRU); receipt of archival tumor tissue is not required for study registration and initiation of therapy\n24.
