GnRH travels through the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates the gland to produce hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones stimulate the testicles or ovaries. The testicles produce testosterone and develop sperm. The ovaries produce estrogen and prepare for ovulation. Normal estrogen and testosterone levels are required for puberty. Some people, however, have either low levels or total lack of GnRH. This can cause problems with puberty and fertility. Researchers want to study people with low or no GnRH to better understand how it affects puberty and fertility.~Objectives:~- To study disorders of GnRH production.~Eligibility:~Adult men and women at least 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.~Adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.~Participants will have tests to look at their hormone levels. Blood samples may be collected after taking different drugs, including insulin and cortisone. A 24-hour urine sample will be collected.~Participants will have imaging studies to look at bone and brain development. They will also have ultrasounds of the kidneys, abdomen, and reproductive organs.~Tests of smell and hearing will be used to look for abnormalities in these senses.\nInclusion criteria:\n 0.

GnRH travels through the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it stimulates the gland to produce hormones called gonadotropins. These hormones stimulate the testicles or ovaries. The testicles produce testosterone and develop sperm. The ovaries produce estrogen and prepare for ovulation. Normal estrogen and testosterone levels are required for puberty. Some people, however, have either low levels or total lack of GnRH. This can cause problems with puberty and fertility. Researchers want to study people with low or no GnRH to better understand how it affects puberty and fertility.~Objectives:~- To study disorders of GnRH production.~Eligibility:~Adult men and women at least 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.~Adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age with low or no gonadotropin levels.~Design:~Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine samples will be collected.~Participants will have tests to look at their hormone levels. Blood samples may be collected after taking different drugs, including insulin and cortisone. A 24-hour urine sample will be collected.~Participants will have imaging studies to look at bone and brain development. They will also have ultrasounds of the kidneys, abdomen, and reproductive organs.~Tests of smell and hearing will be used to look for abnormalities in these senses.\nExclusion criteria:\n 0.

Your task is to compare a given patient note and the inclusion criteria of a clinical trial to determine the patient's eligibility at the criterion level.\nThe factors that allow someone to participate in a clinical study are called inclusion criteria.

For each inclusion criterion, briefly generate your reasoning process: First, judge whether the criterion is not applicable (not very common), where the patient does not meet the premise of the criterion. Then, check if the patient note contains direct evidence. If so, judge whether the patient meets or does not meet the criterion. If there is no direct evidence, try to infer from existing evidence, and answer one question: If the criterion is true, is it possible that a good patient note will miss such information? If impossible, then you can assume that the criterion is not true. Otherwise, there is not enough information.\n\tElement 2.
